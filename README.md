### üì∂ 4. MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)

| Network Type | MTU (bytes) | Explanation                    |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Ethernet** | 1500        | Standard defined by IEEE 802.3 |
| **Wi-Fi**    | 2304        | IEEE 802.11 (MSDU size)        |

*If packet > MTU ‚Üí Fragmentation occurs*

---

### ‚úÇÔ∏è 5. Fragmentation Fields

* **Identification**: Same for all fragments of one packet
* **Flags**:

  * `DF (Don't Fragment)` = 1 ‚Üí No fragmentation allowed
  * `MF (More Fragments)` = 1 ‚Üí More fragments are coming
* **Fragment Offset**: Where the fragment fits in the original packet

---

### üïë 6. TTL (Time to Live)

* Limits the lifespan of the packet in the network
* Each router decreases TTL by **at least 1**
* TTL = 0 ‚Üí Packet is **discarded**

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 7. Protocol Field

Indicates the **next layer's protocol** after IP:

| Protocol | Number | Description                        |

| UDP      | 17     | User Datagram Protocol             |
| ICMP     | 1      | Internet Control Message Protocol  |
| OSPF     | 89     | Open Shortest Path First (routing) |

---

### üîç 8. Header Checksum

* Protects **only the IPv4 header**, not the payload
* Recalculated at each router (because TTL & other fields change)

---

### üß≠ 9. IPv4 Addressing

* **32-bit** addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)
* Old: Classful (A, B, C, D, E) ‚Äì now outdated
* New: **CIDR** (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

---

### üî¢ 10. CIDR and VLSM

| Term        | Meaning                                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CIDR**    | IP/prefix ‚Üí e.g., `192.168.0.0/24`                            |
| **/24**     | 24 bits for network ‚Üí Subnet mask: `255.255.255.0`            |
| **VLSM**    | Variable-Length Subnet Masking ‚Üí Allows flexible subnet sizes |
| **Example** | `123.234.100.56/24` ‚Üí 256 IPs in subnet (2‚Å∏ = 256)            |

---

### üåê 11. Address Allocation

* **IANA** ‚Üí Assigns to **RIRs** (Regional Internet Registries)

* LIRs ‚Üí Assign IPs to end users and ISPs based on need

---

### üß© 12. Options & Padding

* Optional field for extra instructions (e.g., routing, timestamps)
* **Padding** added to make header a multiple of **32 bits**

---

### üìö Reference Points

* **RFC 1594** ‚Üí Definition of *Datagram*
* **IETF Standards** ‚Üí Governing body for IP and internet protocols

### ‚úÖ What is a Datagram?

* A **datagram** is a **self-contained packet** that carries all necessary information to be routed from source to destination **independently**.
* Both **IPv4** and **IPv6** packets are datagrams.

---

### üåê IPv4 vs IPv6

* **IPv4** = 32-bit address, \~4.3 billion addresses
* **IPv6** = 128-bit address, massive number of addresses
* IPv6 headers are **simpler** than IPv4 (e.g., **no Header Checksum** in IPv6)

### üß± IPv4 Packet Structure

**Header (min 20 bytes)** + **Payload**

| Field                        | Purpose                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Version                      | 4 bits. For IPv4 = `0100`                                          |
| IHL                          | Header Length (in 32-bit words). Min = 5 (i.e., 20 bytes)          |
| DS & ECN                     | For Quality of Service & congestion control                        |
| Total Length                 | Max = 65,535 bytes. Total size of packet including header and data |
| Identification               | Used for fragmenting and reassembly                                |
| Flags                        | 3 bits (Don't Fragment = 1, More Fragments = 1, Reserved = 0)      |
| Fragment Offset              | Used for reordering fragments                                      |
| TTL                          | Time To Live, decreases at each hop. If 0, packet is dropped       |
| Protocol                     | Indicates what's in the payload (TCP=6, UDP=17)                    |
| Header Checksum              | Protects **only the header**, recalculated at each router          |
| Source & Destination Address | 32 bits each                                                       |
| Options & Padding            | Rarely used, adds up to multiple of 32-bit words                   |

---

### üñß MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)

* Max IP packet size **depends on Layer 2**:

  * **Ethernet**: 1500 bytes
  * **Wi-Fi**: 2304 bytes
* If IP packet > MTU: fragmentation may occur unless **Don't Fragment flag = 1**

---

### üßÆ CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

* Format: `IP/mask`, e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`
* `/24` means **first 24 bits are network** ‚Üí **255.255.255.0**
* Replaced classful (A, B, C) system
* Uses **VLSM** (Variable Length Subnet Masking) to assign subnet sizes more efficiently
* Enables **IPv4 & IPv6** block allocation to ISPs or users

---

### üßæ Header Checksum (IPv4 only)

* 16-bit field
* Used for error detection in **header only**, **not payload**
* Recomputed at each router due to changes like TTL decrement

---

### üöÄ TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

* **Connection-oriented**, reliable
* Header size: **min 20 bytes**

| Field                   | Purpose                                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Source Port / Dest Port | App layer communication                        |
| Sequence Number         | Order of bytes                                 |
| Acknowledgment Number   | Confirms receipt                               |
| Data Offset             | Header length in 32-bit words                  |
| Flags                   | URG, ACK, PSH, RST, SYN, FIN                   |
| Window                  | Flow control                                   |
| Checksum                | Covers header + data + pseudo header           |
| Urgent Pointer          | Used if URG flag = 1 (urgent data starts here) |

* **PSH Flag**: Pushes data to app immediately
* **URG Flag + Urgent Pointer**: Mark part of data as urgent

---

### üì¶ UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

* **Connectionless**, fast, unreliable
* Header: 8 bytes only

| Field                   | Purpose                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Source Port / Dest Port | Communication                        |
| Length                  | UDP header + data length             |
| Checksum                | Optional in IPv4 (mandatory in IPv6) |

* **No flags**, **no urgent pointer**, **no sequence or ack numbers**
* **TTL is handled by IP**, not UDP/TCP

---

### ‚ùå Common Wrong Statements (For MCQs)

* IPv6 **is** a datagram ‚Üí ‚úÖ TRUE
* IPv4 can always send 65,535 octets ‚Üí ‚ùå FALSE (limited by MTU)
* UDP/TCP has TTL ‚Üí ‚ùå FALSE (TTL is part of IP header)
* IPv4 Jumbogram exists ‚Üí ‚ùå FALSE (Only IPv6 has Jumbograms)
* UDP uses PSH, URG flags ‚Üí ‚ùå FALSE (That‚Äôs TCP-only)
* CIDR is only for IPv4 ‚Üí ‚ùå FALSE (Used for both IPv4 & IPv6)

---

### ‚úÖ IPv6 Jumbograms

* For data > 65,535 bytes
* Payload Length = 0 (all bits zero)
* Jumbo Payload Option header used

---

### üî¢ Binary ‚Üî Hex ‚Üî Decimal Table (IPv6 help)

| Binary                                 | Hex | Decimal |
| -------------------------------------- | --- | ------- |
| 0000                                   | 0x0 | 0       |
| 0001                                   | 0x1 | 1       |
| 1000                                   | 0x8 | 8       |
| 1010                                   | 0xa | 10      |
| 1011                                   | 0xb | 11      |
| 1100                                   | 0xc | 12      |
| 1101                                   | 0xd | 13      |
| 1110                                   | 0xe | 14      |
| 1111                                   | 0xf | 15      |
| **Wrong example**: `0000 = 0xg = 16` ‚ùå |     |         |

---

### ‚ú® Summary

* **IPv4 & IPv6** use datagrams
* **TCP** = reliable, connection-based; **UDP** = fast, connectionless
* **CIDR** is flexible and used in both IPv4/IPv6
* MTU limits packet size despite total length allowing 65,535
* Checksum protects headers; **TCP's checksum covers more**

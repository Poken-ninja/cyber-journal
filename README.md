## 🧨 Common Cyber Attacks and Why They Work – Week 1

### 🎣 Phishing Attacks

Phishing = using digital messages to trick people into revealing sensitive info or installing malware.

Types of phishing:

- Business Email Compromise (BEC): Fake email from known source requesting money or data
- Spear phishing: Targeted email scam toward a specific person or group
- Whaling: Spear phishing aimed at high-level executives
- Vishing: Voice phishing over phone calls or voicemails
- Smishing: Phishing done over SMS (text messages)

---

### 🐛 Malware Attacks

Malware = software created to damage, disrupt, or steal.

Types of malware:

- Virus: Needs user to run it; spreads through files, causes data damage
- Worm: Self-replicates and spreads across systems without user action
- Ransomware: Encrypts data and demands payment to unlock it
- Spyware: Secretly collects data like messages, location, or audio

---

### 🧠 Social Engineering

Social engineering = manipulating people into giving up info or access.

Types of social engineering:

- Social media phishing: Info from social media is used to craft targeted attacks
- Watering hole attack: Hackers infect websites visited by a specific group
- USB baiting: Malware-infected USB dropped for someone to plug in
- Physical access: Impersonation to sneak into secure buildings

---

### 🕵️ Social Engineering Principles

Why it works:

- Authority: Pretend to be boss, tech support, law enforcement
- Intimidation: Scare or pressure victims into acting
- Consensus/Social Proof: “Others already gave me access”
- Scarcity: “Only 2 left” or “time is running out” tactics
- Familiarity: Pretend to know the victim or act casual
- Trust: Build a fake relationship to extract info
- Urgency: Push people to act fast, skip verification

---

### 📝 Key Takeaways

- Attacks use **tech and psychology**
- Social engineering is rising because humans are the weakest link
- Awareness is the first layer of defense
- You'll see these attacks often in real-world scenarios — stay alert

---

A computer virus is malicious code that interferes with computer operations and causes damage. A virus is a type of malware.
The Morris worm helped shape the security industry because it led to the development of computer emergency response teams, now commonly referred to as computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs). 
The key impacts of the Equifax breach were the fact that millions of customers' PII was stolen and that the significant financial consequences of a breach became more apparent. 
The key impacts of the Equifax breach were the fact that millions of customers' PII was stolen and that the significant financial consequences of a breach became more apparent. 
Social engineering, such as phishing, is a manipulation technique that relies on human error (not computer error) to gain private information, access, or valuables.

| **Cryptographic Attack**    | Breaking encryption (e.g., birthday attack, downgrade, collision)           | Communication and Network Security                 |

**Password attack**
A password attack is an attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data. Some forms of password attacks that you’ll learn about later in the certificate program are:  

1.Brute force
2.Rainbow table

Password attacks fall under the communication and network security domain. 

**Social engineering attack**
Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Some forms of social engineering attacks that you will continue to learn about throughout the program are: 

1. Phishing
2. Smishing
3. Vishing
4. Spear phishing
5. Whaling
6. Social media phishing
7. Business Email Compromise (BEC)
8. Watering hole attack
9. USB (Universal Serial Bus) baiting
10. Physical social engineering 

Social engineering attacks are related to the security and risk management domain.

**Physical attack**
A physical attack is a security incident that affects not only digital but also physical environments where the incident is deployed. Some forms of physical attacks are:

2. Malicious flash drive
3. Card cloning and skimming

Physical attacks fall under the asset security domain. 

**Adversarial artificial intelligence**
Adversarial artificial intelligence is a technique that manipulates artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to conduct attacks more efficiently. Adversarial artificial intelligence falls under both the communication and network security and the identity and access management domains.

**Supply-chain attack**
A supply-chain attack targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. Because every item sold undergoes a process that involves third parties, this means that the security breach can occur at any point in the supply chain. These attacks are costly because they can affect multiple organizations and the individuals who work for them. Supply-chain attacks can fall under several domains, including but not limited to the security and risk management, security architecture and engineering, and security operations domains.

**Cryptographic attack**
A cryptographic attack affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. Some forms of cryptographic attacks are: 

1. Birthday
2. Collision
3. Downgrade
4. 
Cryptographic attacks fall under the communication and network security domain.

🛡️ Managing Common Threats, Risks & Vulnerabilities
As cybersecurity professionals, one of our main responsibilities is protecting both digital and physical assets from threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. Understanding the modern threat landscape is critical for creating strong security policies and response strategies.

🎯 Risk Management
An asset is anything of value to an organization, such as:

🔐 Digital assets: SSNs, DOBs, bank details, personal info

🖥️ Physical assets: Servers, kiosks, desktop computers

Common Risk Management Strategies:
Strategy	Description
Acceptance	Accept the risk to maintain business continuity
Avoidance	Avoid activities that introduce the risk
Transference	Transfer risk to a third party (e.g., insurance, vendor)
Mitigation	Reduce the impact/likelihood of the risk

🧰 Frameworks often used:

NIST RMF (Risk Management Framework)

HITRUST (Health Information Trust Alliance)

🚨 Threats
A threat is any event or actor that can negatively impact assets.

Threat Type	Description
Insider Threats	Authorized personnel misusing access
Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)	Long-term, stealthy system compromise by external actors

⚠️ Risks
A risk is the potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability.

Risk = Likelihood of Threat x Impact

Risk Type	Examples
External Risk	Hackers, phishing, malware
Internal Risk	Disgruntled employees, vendor misuse
Legacy Systems	Unpatched, outdated systems still connected
Multiparty Risk	Vendors or third-parties having access to sensitive IP
Compliance Risks	Outdated software or missing security patches

🛑 Stay updated using:

NIST risk catalogs

OWASP Top 10

🕳️ Vulnerabilities
A vulnerability is a weakness that could be exploited by a threat actor.

Vulnerability	Description
ProxyLogon	Remote code execution on Microsoft Exchange servers
ZeroLogon	Exploits Microsoft Netlogon protocol
Log4Shell	Remote code execution via Java’s Log4j utility
PetitPotam	Exploits NTLM for Windows LAN authentication theft
Security Logging Failure	Poor logging/monitoring lets threats go undetected
SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)	Tricks server into exposing internal resources

👨‍💻 Entry-level security analysts often begin in Vulnerability Management – continuously scanning systems, applying patches, and reducing exposure.

🛠️ Quick Summary
Category       	Definition	                            Example
Threat	       Potential harm (event/actor)          	APT, insider misuse
Risk	          Likelihood of threat impacting asset   	Legacy software vulnerability
Vulnerability   A flaw that threat actors can exploit 	Log4Shell exploit in Log4j

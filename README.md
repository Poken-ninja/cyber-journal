### 🐛 Malware Attacks

Malware = software created to damage, disrupt, or steal.

Types of malware:

- Virus: Needs user to run it; spreads through files, causes data damage
- Worm: Self-replicates and spreads across systems without user action
- Ransomware: Encrypts data and demands payment to unlock it
- Spyware: Secretly collects data like messages, location, or audio

---

### 🧠 Social Engineering

Social engineering = manipulating people into giving up info or access.

Types of social engineering:

- Social media phishing: Info from social media is used to craft targeted attacks
- Watering hole attack: Hackers infect websites visited by a specific group
- USB baiting: Malware-infected USB dropped for someone to plug in
- Physical access: Impersonation to sneak into secure buildings

---

### 🕵️ Social Engineering Principles

Why it works:

🛡️ Managing Common Threats, Risks & Vulnerabilities
As cybersecurity professionals, one of our main responsibilities is protecting both digital and physical assets from threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. Understanding the modern threat landscape is critical for creating strong security policies and response strategies.

🎯 Risk Management
An asset is anything of value to an organization, such as:

🔐 Digital assets: SSNs, DOBs, bank details, personal info

🖥️ Physical assets: Servers, kiosks, desktop computers

Common Risk Management Strategies:
Strategy	Description
Acceptance	Accept the risk to maintain business continuity
Avoidance	Avoid activities that introduce the risk
Transference	Transfer risk to a third party (e.g., insurance, vendor)
Mitigation	Reduce the impact/likelihood of the risk

🧰 Frameworks often used:

NIST RMF (Risk Management Framework)

HITRUST (Health Information Trust Alliance)

🚨 Threats
A threat is any event or actor that can negatively impact assets.

Threat Type	Description
Insider Threats	Authorized personnel misusing access
Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)	Long-term, stealthy system compromise by external actors

⚠️ Risks
A risk is the potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability.

Risk = Likelihood of Threat x Impact

Risk Type	Examples
External Risk	Hackers, phishing, malware
Internal Risk	Disgruntled employees, vendor misuse
Legacy Systems	Unpatched, outdated systems still connected
Multiparty Risk	Vendors or third-parties having access to sensitive IP
Compliance Risks	Outdated software or missing security patches

🛑 Stay updated using:

NIST risk catalogs

OWASP Top 10

🕳️ Vulnerabilities
A vulnerability is a weakness that could be exploited by a threat actor.

Vulnerability	Description

| **Destination Address** | 32 bits  | IPv4 destination IP                                                               |
| **Options + Padding**   | Variable | Optional settings; padding aligns to 32-bit boundary                              |

---

### 📶 4. MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)

| Network Type | MTU (bytes) | Explanation                    |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Ethernet** | 1500        | Standard defined by IEEE 802.3 |
| **Wi-Fi**    | 2304        | IEEE 802.11 (MSDU size)        |

*If packet > MTU → Fragmentation occurs*

---

### ✂️ 5. Fragmentation Fields

* **Identification**: Same for all fragments of one packet
* **Flags**:

  * `DF (Don't Fragment)` = 1 → No fragmentation allowed
  * `MF (More Fragments)` = 1 → More fragments are coming
* **Fragment Offset**: Where the fragment fits in the original packet

---

### 🕑 6. TTL (Time to Live)

* Limits the lifespan of the packet in the network
* Each router decreases TTL by **at least 1**
* TTL = 0 → Packet is **discarded**

---

### ⚙️ 7. Protocol Field

Indicates the **next layer's protocol** after IP:

| Protocol | Number | Description                        |
| -------- | ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| TCP      | 6      | Transmission Control Protocol      |
| UDP      | 17     | User Datagram Protocol             |
| ICMP     | 1      | Internet Control Message Protocol  |
| OSPF     | 89     | Open Shortest Path First (routing) |

---

### 🔍 8. Header Checksum

* Protects **only the IPv4 header**, not the payload
* Recalculated at each router (because TTL & other fields change)

---

### 🧭 9. IPv4 Addressing

* **32-bit** addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)
* Old: Classful (A, B, C, D, E) – now outdated
* New: **CIDR** (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

---

### 🔢 10. CIDR and VLSM

| Term        | Meaning                                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CIDR**    | IP/prefix → e.g., `192.168.0.0/24`                            |
| **/24**     | 24 bits for network → Subnet mask: `255.255.255.0`            |
| **VLSM**    | Variable-Length Subnet Masking → Allows flexible subnet sizes |
| **Example** | `123.234.100.56/24` → 256 IPs in subnet (2⁸ = 256)            |

---

### 🌐 11. Address Allocation

* **IANA** → Assigns to **RIRs** (Regional Internet Registries)
* RIRs → Assign to **LIRs** (Local Internet Registries)
* LIRs → Assign IPs to end users and ISPs based on need

---

### 🧩 12. Options & Padding

* Optional field for extra instructions (e.g., routing, timestamps)
* **Padding** added to make header a multiple of **32 bits**

---

### 📚 Reference Points

* **RFC 1594** → Definition of *Datagram*
* **IETF Standards** → Governing body for IP and internet protocols

### ✅ What is a Datagram?

* A **datagram** is a **self-contained packet** that carries all necessary information to be routed from source to destination **independently**.
* Both **IPv4** and **IPv6** packets are datagrams.

---

### 🌐 IPv4 vs IPv6

* **IPv4** = 32-bit address, \~4.3 billion addresses
* **IPv6** = 128-bit address, massive number of addresses
* IPv6 headers are **simpler** than IPv4 (e.g., **no Header Checksum** in IPv6)

---

### 🧱 IPv4 Packet Structure

**Header (min 20 bytes)** + **Payload**

| Field                        | Purpose                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Version                      | 4 bits. For IPv4 = `0100`                                          |
| IHL                          | Header Length (in 32-bit words). Min = 5 (i.e., 20 bytes)          |
| DS & ECN                     | For Quality of Service & congestion control                        |
| Total Length                 | Max = 65,535 bytes. Total size of packet including header and data |
| Identification               | Used for fragmenting and reassembly                                |
| Flags                        | 3 bits (Don't Fragment = 1, More Fragments = 1, Reserved = 0)      |
| Fragment Offset              | Used for reordering fragments                                      |
| TTL                          | Time To Live, decreases at each hop. If 0, packet is dropped       |
| Protocol                     | Indicates what's in the payload (TCP=6, UDP=17)                    |
| Header Checksum              | Protects **only the header**, recalculated at each router          |
| Source & Destination Address | 32 bits each                                                       |
| Options & Padding            | Rarely used, adds up to multiple of 32-bit words                   |

---

### 🖧 MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)

* Max IP packet size **depends on Layer 2**:

  * **Ethernet**: 1500 bytes
  * **Wi-Fi**: 2304 bytes
* If IP packet > MTU: fragmentation may occur unless **Don't Fragment flag = 1**

---

### 🧮 CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

* Format: `IP/mask`, e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`
* `/24` means **first 24 bits are network** → **255.255.255.0**
* Replaced classful (A, B, C) system
* Uses **VLSM** (Variable Length Subnet Masking) to assign subnet sizes more efficiently
* Enables **IPv4 & IPv6** block allocation to ISPs or users

---

### 🧾 Header Checksum (IPv4 only)

* 16-bit field
* Used for error detection in **header only**, **not payload**
* Recomputed at each router due to changes like TTL decrement

---

### 🚀 TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

* **Connection-oriented**, reliable
* Header size: **min 20 bytes**

| Field                   | Purpose                                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Source Port / Dest Port | App layer communication                        |
| Sequence Number         | Order of bytes                                 |
| Acknowledgment Number   | Confirms receipt                               |
| Data Offset             | Header length in 32-bit words                  |
| Flags                   | URG, ACK, PSH, RST, SYN, FIN                   |
| Window                  | Flow control                                   |
| Checksum                | Covers header + data + pseudo header           |
| Urgent Pointer          | Used if URG flag = 1 (urgent data starts here) |

* **PSH Flag**: Pushes data to app immediately
* **URG Flag + Urgent Pointer**: Mark part of data as urgent

---

### 📦 UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

* **Connectionless**, fast, unreliable
* Header: 8 bytes only

| Field                   | Purpose                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Source Port / Dest Port | Communication                        |
| Length                  | UDP header + data length             |
| Checksum                | Optional in IPv4 (mandatory in IPv6) |

* **No flags**, **no urgent pointer**, **no sequence or ack numbers**
* **TTL is handled by IP**, not UDP/TCP

---

### ❌ Common Wrong Statements (For MCQs)

* IPv6 **is** a datagram → ✅ TRUE
* IPv4 can always send 65,535 octets → ❌ FALSE (limited by MTU)
* UDP/TCP has TTL → ❌ FALSE (TTL is part of IP header)
* IPv4 Jumbogram exists → ❌ FALSE (Only IPv6 has Jumbograms)
* UDP uses PSH, URG flags → ❌ FALSE (That’s TCP-only)
* CIDR is only for IPv4 → ❌ FALSE (Used for both IPv4 & IPv6)

---

### ✅ IPv6 Jumbograms

* For data > 65,535 bytes
* Payload Length = 0 (all bits zero)
* Jumbo Payload Option header used

---

### 🔢 Binary ↔ Hex ↔ Decimal Table (IPv6 help)

| Binary                                 | Hex | Decimal |
| -------------------------------------- | --- | ------- |
| 0000                                   | 0x0 | 0       |

| 1101                                   | 0xd | 13      |
| 1110                                   | 0xe | 14      |
| 1111                                   | 0xf | 15      |
| **Wrong example**: `0000 = 0xg = 16` ❌ |     |         |

---

### ✨ Summary

* **IPv4 & IPv6** use datagrams
* **TCP** = reliable, connection-based; **UDP** = fast, connectionless
* **CIDR** is flexible and used in both IPv4/IPv6
* MTU limits packet size despite total length allowing 65,535
* Checksum protects headers; **TCP's checksum covers more**

## 🌐 Internet Routing & Protocols (IGP vs EGP)

### 🔸 Autonomous Systems (AS)

* **Autonomous System**: A network (like an ISP, university, or enterprise) controlled by a single admin.

### 🔸 IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol)

* Used **within** an AS.
* Examples:

  * **RIP** (Routing Information Protocol) – Distance-vector
  * **OSPF** (Open Shortest Path First) – Link-state
  * **IS-IS** – Link-state
  * **EIGRP** – Cisco proprietary, hybrid

### 🔸 EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol)

* Used **between** ASes.
* Example:

  * **BGPv4** (Border Gateway Protocol v4)

    * Used **on the Internet**.
    * Supports **external BGP (eBGP)** & **internal BGP (iBGP)**.

### 🔒 BGP Security Challenges

* Different ISPs → different encryption/security protocols → harder coordination
* BGP messages vulnerable to **spoofing** & **malware** if not properly secured

---

## 📡 OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)

### 📌 Overview

* Most widely used IGP
* Supports **IPv4, IPv6, CIDR**
* Uses **Link-State Routing** and **Dijkstra's Algorithm**

### 🧠 How It Works

1. Routers collect **Link-State Advertisements (LSAs)**
2. Build **Link-State Database (LSDB)**
3. Compute **Shortest Path Tree (SPT)** from the source
4. Populate routing table based on SPT

### 🔁 Updates

* If network changes, all steps repeat to maintain accuracy.

### ⚖️ Link Cost Factors

* **Hop count**, **RTT**, **throughput**, **availability**, **reliability**

### 📐 Dijkstra’s Algorithm Steps

1. Start with only source node in set `M`
2. Add nearest neighbor with minimum cumulative link cost
3. Repeat until all nodes are in set `M`
4. Result = shortest path tree with **no loops**

### 📊 Routing Table Example

* Source → Destination with least cost path

### 🧩 OSPF Router Types

* **IR** (Internal Router): All interfaces in same area
* **ABR** (Area Border Router): Connects sub-areas to backbone
* **BR** (Backbone Router): Within backbone area
* **ASBR** (Autonomous System Boundary Router): Connects ASes

### 📣 Multicast OSPF (MOSPF)

* Extension of OSPF for multicast routing
* Uses **group membership** info
* Alternate: OSPF with **PIM** (Protocol Independent Multicast)

### 🌐 OSPF Subdivision

* Divides large network into subareas + backbone
* Benefits: better administration, performance, security

### 🚦 Traffic Engineering

* Goal: Optimize routing reliability and performance
* Works for IP & Optical networks

## 🧭 Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) & NDP

### 📌 ARP

* Maps **IPv4 address → MAC address** (Data Link Layer)
* Used in **Ethernet** and **Wi-Fi**
* Defined in **RFC 826**
* Managed by **IANA**

### 🧾 ARP Packet Format

| Field                | Description               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Hardware Type        | Ethernet = 1              |
| Protocol Type        | IPv4 = 0x0800             |
| Hardware Addr Length | 6 (MAC)                   |
| Protocol Addr Length | 4 (IPv4)                  |
| Operation            | 1=Request, 2=Reply        |
| Sender MAC           | Sender’s MAC              |
| Sender IP            | Sender’s IP               |
| Target MAC           | Receiver’s MAC (if known) |
| Target IP            | Receiver’s IP             |

### 📌 NDP (Neighbor Discovery Protocol)

* Used in **IPv6** (replaces ARP)
* Also maps IPv6 → MAC
* Used for Wi-Fi and other IPv6-enabled networks

  * **Hides internal structure**, adding **security**
  * Conserves **IPv4 public address space**, which is nearly exhausted

---

## 🛰 RPC (Remote Procedure Call)

* Enables **remote execution** of functions on another machine
* Acts like a local call for the developer
* **Flow**:

  1. Client sends **request** with parameters to server
  2. Server **executes** procedure & sends back response
* Needs **recovery mechanisms** for network failures

---

## 📁 FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

### 🔐 Security

* Defined in **RFC 959**
* Uses **TCP/IP**

Overview of network protocols
A network protocol is a set of rules used by two or more devices on a network to describe the order of delivery and the structure of data. Network protocols serve as instructions that come with the information in the data packet. These instructions tell the receiving device what to do with the data. Protocols are like a common language that allows devices all across the world to communicate with and understand each other.

Even though network protocols perform an essential function in network communication, security analysts should still understand their associated security implications. Some protocols have vulnerabilities that malicious actors exploit. For example, a nefarious actor could use the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol, which resolves web addresses to IP addresses, to divert traffic from a legitimate website to a malicious website containing malware. You’ll learn more about this topic in upcoming course materials. 

Three categories of network protocols
Network protocols can be divided into three main categories: communication protocols, management protocols, and security protocols. There are dozens of different network protocols, but you don’t need to memorize all of them for an entry-level security analyst role. However, it’s important for you to know the ones listed in this reading. 

Communication protocols
Communication protocols govern the exchange of information in network transmission. They dictate how the data is transmitted between devices and the timing of the communication. They also include methods to recover data lost in transit. Here are a few of them.

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is an internet communication protocol that allows two devices to form a connection and stream data. TCP uses a three-way handshake process. First, the device sends a synchronize (SYN) request to a server. Then the server responds with a SYN/ACK packet to acknowledge receipt of the device's request. Once the server receives the final ACK packet from the device, a TCP connection is established. In the TCP/IP model, TCP occurs at the transport layer.

User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol that does not establish a connection between devices before a transmission. This makes it less reliable than TCP. But it also means that it works well for transmissions that need to get to their destination quickly. For example, one use of UDP is for sending DNS requests to local DNS servers. In the TCP/IP model, UDP occurs at the transport layer.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol that provides a method of communication between clients and website servers. HTTP uses port 80. HTTP is considered insecure, so it is being replaced on most websites by a secure version, called HTTPS that uses encryption from SSL/TLS for communication. However, there are still many websites that use the insecure HTTP protocol. In the TCP/IP model, HTTP occurs at the application layer.

Domain Name System (DNS) is a protocol that translates internet domain names into IP addresses. When a client computer wishes to access a website domain using their internet browser, a query is sent to a dedicated DNS server. The DNS server then looks up the IP address that corresponds to the website domain. DNS normally uses UDP on port 53. However, if the DNS reply to a request is large, it will switch to using the TCP protocol. In the TCP/IP model, DNS occurs at the application layer.

Management Protocols
The next category of network protocols is management protocols. Management protocols are used for monitoring and managing activity on a network. They include protocols for error reporting and optimizing performance on the network.

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a network protocol used for monitoring and managing devices on a network. SNMP can reset a password on a network device or change its baseline configuration. It can also send requests to network devices for a report on how much of the network’s bandwidth is being used up. In the TCP/IP model, SNMP occurs at the application layer.

Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is an internet protocol used by devices to tell each other about data transmission errors across the network. ICMP is used by a receiving device to send a report to the sending device about the data transmission. ICMP is commonly used as a quick way to troubleshoot network connectivity and latency by issuing the “ping” command on a Linux operating system. In the TCP/IP model, ICMP occurs at the internet layer.

Security Protocols
Security protocols are network protocols that ensure that data is sent and received securely across a network. Security protocols use encryption algorithms to protect data in transit. Below are some common security protocols.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is a network protocol that provides a secure method of communication between clients and website servers. HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that uses secure sockets layer/transport layer security (SSL/TLS) encryption on all transmissions so that malicious actors cannot read the information contained. HTTPS uses port 443. In the TCP/IP model, HTTPS occurs at the application layer.

Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is a secure protocol used to transfer files from one device to another over a network. SFTP uses secure shell (SSH), typically through TCP port 22. SSH uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and other types of encryption to ensure that unintended recipients cannot intercept the transmissions. In the TCP/IP model, SFTP occurs at the application layer. SFTP is used often with cloud storage. Every time a user uploads or downloads a file from cloud storage, the file is transferred using the SFTP protocol.

Note: The encryption protocols mentioned do not conceal the source or destination IP address of network traffic. This means a malicious actor can still learn some basic information about the network traffic if they intercept it. 

Additional network protocols
In previous readings and videos, you learned how network protocols organize the sending and receiving of data across a network. You also learned that protocols can be divided into three categories: communication protocols, management protocols, and security protocols.

This reading will introduce you to a few additional concepts and protocols that will come up regularly in your work as a security analyst. Some protocols are assigned port numbers by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). These port numbers are included in the description of each protocol, if assigned. 

Network Address Translation
The devices on your local home or office network each have a private IP address that they use to communicate directly with each other. However, in order for the devices with private IP addresses to communicate with the public internet, they need to have a single public IP address that represents all devices on the LAN to the public. For outgoing messages, the router can replace a private source IP address with its public IP address and perform the reverse operation for responses. This process is known as Network Address Translation (NAT) and it generally requires a router or firewall to be specifically configured to perform NAT. NAT is a part of layer 2 (internet layer) and layer 3 (transport layer) of the TCP/IP model.

## Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol:
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is in the management family of network protocols. DHCP is an application layer protocol used on a network to configure devices. It works with the router to assign a unique IP address to each device and provide the addresses of the appropriate DNS server and default gateway for each device. DHCP servers operate on UDP port 67 while DHCP clients operate on UDP port 68.

Address Resolution Protocol
By now, you are familiar with IP and MAC addresses. You’ve learned that each device on a network has a public IP address, a private IP address, and a MAC address that identify it on the network. A device’s IP address may change over time, but its MAC address is permanent because it is unique to a device's network interface card. The MAC address is used to communicate with devices within the same network, but sometimes, the MAC address is unknown. This is why the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is needed. ARP is mainly a network access layer protocol in the TCP/IP model used to translate the IP addresses that are found in data packets into the MAC address of the hardware device. 

Each device on the network performs ARP and keeps track of matching IP and MAC addresses in an ARP cache. ARP does not have a specific port number since it is a layer 2 protocol and port numbers are associated with the layer 7 application layer.

Telnet 
Telnet is an application layer protocol that is used to connect with a remote system. Telnet sends all information in clear text. It uses command line prompts to control another device similar to secure shell (SSH), but Telnet is not as secure as SSH. Telnet can be used to connect to local or remote devices and uses TCP port 23. 

Secure shell
Secure shell protocol (SSH) is used to create a secure connection with a remote system. This application layer protocol provides an alternative for secure authentication and encrypted communication. SSH operates over the TCP port 22 and is a replacement for less secure protocols, such as Telnet.

Post office protocol
Post office protocol (POP) is an application layer (layer 4 of the TCP/IP model) protocol used to manage and retrieve email from a mail server. POP3 is the most commonly used version of POP. Many organizations have a dedicated mail server on the network that handles incoming and outgoing mail for users on the network. User devices will send requests to the remote mail server and download email messages locally. If you have ever refreshed your email application and had new emails populate in your inbox, you are experiencing POP and internet message access protocol (IMAP) in action. Unencrypted, plaintext authentication uses TCP/UDP port 110 and encrypted emails use Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) over TCP/UDP port 995.  When using POP, mail has to finish downloading on a local device before it can be read. After downloading, the mail may or may not be deleted from the mail server, so it does not guarantee that a user can sync the same email across multiple devices. 

Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
IMAP is used for incoming email. It downloads the headers of emails and the message content. The content also remains on the email server, which allows users to access their email from multiple devices. IMAP uses TCP port 143 for unencrypted email and TCP port 993 over the TLS protocol. Using IMAP allows users to partially read email before it is finished downloading. Since the mail is kept on the mail server, it allows a user to sync emails across multiple devices. 

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used to transmit and route email from the sender to the recipient’s address. SMTP works with Message Transfer Agent (MTA) software, which searches DNS servers to resolve email addresses to IP addresses, to ensure emails reach their intended destination. SMTP uses TCP/UDP port 25 for unencrypted emails and TCP/UDP port 587 using TLS for encrypted emails. The TCP port 25 is often used by high-volume spam. SMTP helps to filter out spam by regulating how many emails a source can send at a time.

Protocols and port numbers
Remember that port numbers are used by network devices to determine what should be done with the information contained in each data packet once they reach their destination. Firewalls can filter out unwanted traffic based on port numbers. For example, an organization may configure a firewall to only allow access to TCP port 995 (POP3) by IP addresses belonging to the organization.

As a security analyst, you will need to know about many of the protocols and port numbers mentioned in this course. They may be used to determine your technical knowledge in interviews, so it’s a good idea to memorize them. You will also learn about new protocols on the job in a security position.

## 🧠 **Subnetting and CIDR – Easy Summary for Cybersecurity**

---

### 🔹 What is Subnetting?

**Subnetting** = Dividing a large network into **smaller logical networks** (called **subnets**).

* Think of it as **"a network inside a network."**
* Helps isolate zones: 📦 internal, 🔒 restricted, 🌐 public (like DMZ).
* Increases **efficiency**, **speed**, and **security**.
* Used to create **security zones** like:

  * ✅ Controlled zone
  * 🚫 Restricted zone
  * 🌍 Uncontrolled zone
  * ⚔️ DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)

---

### 🧱 Why Use Subnetting?

* Limits traffic within subnets (local traffic doesn’t go to the router).
* Segments **sensitive systems** from **public-facing** ones.
* Reduces **attack surface** – limits lateral movement in attacks.
* Allows **more control** over bandwidth and policies per subnet.

---

### 🔹 CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

**CIDR Notation** = `IP address / Prefix`

Example: `192.168.1.0/24`

* `/24` = Network mask with **24 bits for network**, remaining **8 bits for hosts**.
* IP Range = `192.168.1.0 → 192.168.1.255` (total: **256 IPs**)

#### 🆚 CIDR vs Classful:

| Feature           | Classful             | CIDR                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Uses fixed ranges | Yes (Class A/B/C...) | No                      |
| Efficient?        | ❌ Wasteful           | ✅ More efficient        |
| Routing tables?   | Large                | Compact (fewer entries) |
| Flexibility       | Low                  | High                    |

---

### 📐 CIDR Benefits in Security

* Allows you to create **custom-sized networks** (no IP waste).
* Helps create **network segmentation** strategies (e.g., isolating IoT or HR devices).
* You don’t need to request new IPs from ISP — saves cost and setup time.
* Can work with:

  * 🔄 **Routing configurations**
  * 🔥 **Firewalls**
  * 🛡️ **Security zones**

---

### ✅ Example Use Case:

* A company wants to separate **HR**, **IT**, and **Guest Wi-Fi**.
* Subnetting helps create:

  * `192.168.10.0/24` → HR
  * `192.168.20.0/24` → IT
  * `192.168.30.0/24` → Guests
    Each is isolated from the others = **better security + performance**.

---

### 🔧 Tools You Can Use

* **CIDR Calculator**: [https://ipaddressguide.com/cidr](https://ipaddressguide.com/cidr)
* Converts:

  * CIDR → IP range
  * IP range → CIDR
  * Helpful for planning firewall rules and routing

### 🔐 Summary: Why Subnetting Matters in Cybersecurity

| Benefit             | Explanation                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Network isolation   | Stops threats from spreading laterally      |
| Efficient IP usage  | Custom IP ranges → No waste                 |
| Better routing      | Smaller routing tables                      |
| Improved monitoring | Easier to detect unusual traffic per subnet |
| Access control      | Firewalls and ACLs can be subnet-specific   |

Brute Force Attacks & OS Hardening – Notes
🛑 What is a Brute Force Attack?
A brute force attack is a trial-and-error method used by attackers to guess login credentials and gain unauthorized access to a system.

🔸 Types:
Simple Brute Force Attack: Random combinations of usernames and passwords are tried until a match is found.

Dictionary Attack: Attackers use precompiled lists of common passwords or leaked credentials to speed up the guessing process.

⚠️ These methods can be automated using brute force tools.

🧪 Vulnerability Assessment Techniques
💻 Virtual Machines (VMs)
Act as isolated environments for testing malware and software safely.

Key features:

Revert to a previous clean state.

Prevents host OS damage (in most cases).

Can be easily deleted or reset.

🧫 Sandbox Environments
Used to run untrusted code outside the production network.

Helps detect malware behavior, test patches, simulate attacks.

Can be physical machines or VM/cloud-based.

⚠️ Some malware can detect sandbox/VM and avoid showing malicious behavior.

🧰 Brute Force Attack Prevention Measures
✅ Salting & Hashing
Hashing: One-way encryption of data (cannot reverse).

Salting: Adds randomness to passwords before hashing to prevent precomputed attacks (like rainbow tables).

✅ Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) / Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Requires users to verify their identity using:

Password + OTP

Password + Biometric

Password + Email/Phone confirmation

✅ CAPTCHA / reCAPTCHA
Ensures the login attempt is made by a human, not a bot.

Google’s reCAPTCHA is widely used on websites.

✅ Strong Password Policies
Guidelines for users, including:

Minimum length & complexity

Password expiration & rotation

No reuse of old passwords

Lockout after X failed attempts

🧱 OS Hardening
Applying security configurations to reduce the attack surface of the operating system.

Tasks include:

Disabling unused services

Applying security patches

Configuring firewalls and permissions

Removing default credentials

🧠 Summary
Brute force attacks exploit weak credentials. Organizations must combine secure authentication, system isolation (VMs/sandboxes), and hardening practices to protect against such threats effectively.

## ☁️ Cloud Security Considerations

Earlier in this course, I was introduced to **cloud computing**, a model that enables convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. These resources can be provisioned and released with minimal management effort or interaction with the service provider.

Just like traditional IT infrastructure, **cloud infrastructure must be secured**. This entry explores the unique security challenges presented by cloud computing and introduces the **shared responsibility model**.

---

### 🔐 Key Cloud Security Considerations

#### 1. Identity Access Management (IAM)
- IAM involves the processes and technologies used to manage **digital identities**.
- Improper configuration of user roles can give unauthorized users access to critical cloud operations.
- Proper role-based access controls are essential to minimize this risk.

#### 2. Configuration Management
- Cloud services require precise and secure configuration.
- During **cloud migrations**, improperly configured services can introduce major vulnerabilities.
- Misconfigurations are among the **leading causes of cloud security breaches**.

#### 3. Attack Surface Expansion
- Each service or application added to the cloud increases the **organization’s attack surface**.
- More services = more entry points, unless the network is designed securely.
- CSPs generally offer more secure, vetted infrastructure than traditional on-prem solutions.

#### 4. Zero-Day Attacks
- A **zero-day attack** exploits previously unknown vulnerabilities.
- CSPs typically discover and respond to zero-days faster than traditional IT teams.
- CSPs patch hypervisors and migrate workloads to prevent customer impact.

#### 5. Visibility & Tracking
- Like on-prem networks, cloud offers visibility via **flow logs** and **packet mirroring** tools.
- However, organizations may not be able to inspect the underlying CSP infrastructure.
- CSPs conduct **third-party audits** to verify the security posture and compliance.

#### 6. Rapid Changes in the Cloud
- Cloud services are updated frequently by CSPs, which can impact:
  - Network connectivity
  - Security settings
  - Configuration requirements
- Organizations must **adapt their IT processes** to align with CSP updates.

---

### 🤝 Shared Responsibility Model

- **Cloud Service Provider (CSP)** is responsible for:
  - Physical data centers
  - Host operating systems
  - Hypervisors and infrastructure-level security

- **Cloud Customers** are responsible for:
  - Data security
  - Application configurations
  - User access controls

Misunderstanding the division of responsibility can lead to security lapses, especially in **application-level misconfigurations**.

---

### ✅ Key Takeaways

- Cloud computing introduces **unique security challenges** that require proactive measures.
- **Identity access management**, **configuration security**, and **visibility** are core pillars.
- The **shared responsibility model** clarifies which security roles belong to the CSP and which are owned by the organization.
- Cloud adoption should be paired with **continuous monitoring**, **secure configurations**, and **trained security personnel**.

---
## 🔒 Cloud Security Hardening & Cryptography

Cloud infrastructure is becoming increasingly common, and like on-premise networks, cloud environments must also be secured. This entry explores **cloud security hardening practices**, **cryptography**, and the **shared responsibility model**—all key to protecting data and services in the cloud.

---

### 🛡️ Common Cloud Security Hardening Techniques

Cloud security hardening involves using tools and best practices to **protect cloud network infrastructure** from threats. Below are the main techniques:

---

#### 1. Identity Access Management (IAM)
- IAM helps manage **digital user identities** and defines **who can do what** in the cloud.
- It ensures **authorized access** to cloud services while preventing unauthorized use.
- Weak or misconfigured IAM settings are a **common vulnerability**.

---

#### 2. Hypervisors
- A **hypervisor** separates the hardware from the virtual machines (VMs) running on it.
- Two types:
  - **Type 1 (bare-metal)**: Runs directly on hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi) – used by CSPs.
  - **Type 2**: Runs on a host OS (e.g., VirtualBox).
- CSPs manage hypervisors and patch them regularly.
- **VM Escape**: A major threat where a hacker breaks out of a VM to access other systems.

---

#### 3. Baselining
- **Baselining** sets a **standard reference configuration** for the cloud environment.
- Helps detect and respond to unauthorized changes.
- Examples:
  - Restricting access to admin portals
  - Enabling password policies and encryption
  - Enabling threat detection (e.g., for SQL databases)

---

### 🔐 Cryptography in the Cloud

Cryptography protects **data confidentiality and integrity** in cloud environments. It uses encryption and secure key management systems.

---

#### 4. Encryption
- **Encryption** scrambles data into unreadable format (ciphertext) using a key.
- Only those with the **decryption key** can read the original data.
- Modern encryption depends on **key secrecy**, not algorithm secrecy.

---

#### 5. Cryptographic Erasure (Crypto-Shredding)
- Involves **destroying encryption keys** instead of data itself.
- Without the key, **data becomes unreadable**.
- Used when cloud data needs to be **securely deleted**.

---

### 🔑 Key Management in the Cloud

Proper key management is crucial to prevent unauthorized data access. Two common tools:

- **Trusted Platform Module (TPM)**: A chip that securely stores keys and credentials.
- **Cloud Hardware Security Module (CloudHSM)**: Manages cryptographic keys and operations like encryption/decryption in the cloud.

> ⚠️ Note: 
> Customers can bring their own encryption keys (BYOK). If lost or exposed, **CSPs cannot help recover the data**. You're responsible for your key's security.

---

### 🧠 Shared Responsibility in Cryptography

Under the **shared responsibility model**:
- The **CSP** secures infrastructure (e.g., hypervisors, hardware, host OS).
- The **customer** secures:
  - Application-level configurations
  - IAM settings
  - Encryption keys (if BYOK is used)

Customers can also review **CSP audit reports and security certifications**. For government work, FEDRAMP provides a list of verified CSPs.

---

### ✅ Key Takeaways

- **Cloud security hardening** involves IAM, hypervisors, baselining, encryption, and crypto-erasure.
- **Cryptography** is essential to secure data at rest and in transit.
- Proper **key management** and understanding your role in the **shared responsibility model** are critical to cloud data protection.

Previously, you explored how to manage the file system using Linux commands. The following commands were introduced: mkdir, rmdir, touch, rm, mv, and cp. In this reading, you’ll review these commands, the nano text editor, and learn another way to write to files.

Creating and modifying directories

mkdir

The mkdir command creates a new directory. Like all of the commands presented in this reading, you can either provide the new directory as the absolute file path, which starts from the root, or as a relative file path, which starts from your current directory.

For example, if you want to create a new directory called network in your /home/analyst/logs directory, you can enter mkdir /home/analyst/logs/network to create this new directory. If you’re already in the /home/analyst/logs directory, you can also create this new directory by entering mkdir network.

Pro Tip: You can use the ls command to confirm the new directory was added.

rmdir

The rmdir command removes, or deletes, a directory. For example, entering rmdir /home/analyst/logs/network would remove this empty directory from the file system.

Note: The rmdir command cannot delete directories with files or subdirectories inside. For example, entering rmdir /home/analyst returns an error message. 

Creating and modifying files

touch and rm

The touch command creates a new file. This file won’t have any content inside. If your current directory is /home/analyst/reports, entering touch permissions.txt creates a new file in the reports subdirectory called permissions.txt.

The rm command removes, or deletes, a file. This command should be used carefully because it’s not easy to recover files deleted with rm. To remove the permissions file you just created, enter rm permissions.txt. 

Pro Tip: You can verify that permissions.txt was successfully created or removed by entering ls.

mv and cp

You can also use mv and cp when working with files. The mv command moves a file or directory to a new location, and the cp command copies a file or directory into a new location. The first argument after mv or cp is the file or directory you want to move or copy, and the second argument is the location you want to move or copy it to.

To move permissions.txt into the logs subdirectory, enter mv permissions.txt /home/analyst/logs. Moving a file removes the file from its original location. However, copying a file doesn’t remove it from its original location. To copy permissions.txt into the logs subdirectory while also keeping it in its original location, enter cp permissions.txt /home/analyst/logs.

Note: The mv command can also be used to rename files. To rename a file, pass the new name in as the second argument instead of the new location. For example, entering mv permissions.txt perm.txt renames the permissions.txt file to perm.txt.

nano text editor

nano is a command-line file editor that is available by default in many Linux distributions. Many beginners find it easy to use, and it’s widely used in the security profession. You can perform multiple basic tasks in nano, such as creating new files and modifying file contents. 

To open an existing file in nano from the directory that contains it, enter nano followed by the file name. For example, entering nano permissions.txt from the /home/analyst/reports directory opens a new nano editing window with the permissions.txt file open for editing. You can also provide the absolute file path to the file if you’re not in the directory that contains it.

You can also create a new file in nano by entering nano followed by a new file name. For example, entering nano authorized_users.txt from the /home/analyst/reports directory creates the authorized_users.txt file within that directory and opens it in a new nano editing window.

Since there isn't an auto-saving feature in nano, it’s important to save your work before exiting. To save a file in nano, use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + O. You’ll be prompted to confirm the file name before saving. To exit out of nano, use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + X.

Note: Vim and Emacs are also popular command-line text editors.

Standard output redirection

There’s an additional way you can write to files. Previously, you learned about standard input and standard output. Standard input is information received by the OS via the command line, and standard output is information returned by the OS through the shell.

You’ve also learned about piping. Piping sends the standard output of one command as standard input to another command for further processing. It uses the pipe character (|). 

In addition to the pipe (|), you can also use the right angle bracket (>) and double right angle bracket (>>) operators to redirect standard output.

When used with echo, the > and >> operators can be used to send the output of echo to a specified file rather than the screen. The difference between the two is that > overwrites your existing file, and >> adds your content to the end of the existing file instead of overwriting it. The > operator should be used carefully, because it’s not easy to recover overwritten files.

When you’re inside the directory containing the permissions.txt file, entering echo "last updated date" >> permissions.txt adds the string “last updated date” to the file contents. Entering echo "time" > permissions.txt after this command overwrites the entire file contents of permissions.txt with the string “time”.

Note: Both the > and >> operators will create a new file if one doesn’t already exist with your specified name.
-----
Previously, you explored authorization, authentication, and Linux commands with sudo, useradd, and userdel. The sudo command is important for security analysts because it allows users to have elevated permissions without risking the system by running commands as the root user. You’ll continue exploring authorization, authentication, and Linux commands in this reading and learn two more commands that can be used with sudo: usermod and chown. 

Responsible use of sudo

To manage authorization and authentication, you need to be a root user, or a user with elevated privileges to modify the system. The root user can also be called the “super user.” You become a root user by logging in as the root user. However, running commands as the root user is not recommended in Linux because it can create security risks if malicious actors compromise that account. It’s also easy to make irreversible mistakes, and the system can’t track who ran a command. For these reasons, rather than logging in as the root user, it’s recommended you use sudo in Linux when you need elevated privileges.

The sudo command temporarily grants elevated permissions to specific users. The name of this command comes from “super user do.” Users must be given access in a configuration file to use sudo. This file is called the “sudoers file.” Although using sudo is preferable to logging in as the root user, it's important to be aware that users with the elevated permissions to use sudo might be more at risk in the event of an attack.

You can compare this to a hotel with a master key. The master key can be used to access any room in the hotel. There are some workers at the hotel who need this key to perform their work. For example, to clean all the rooms, the janitor would scan their ID badge and then use this master key. However, if someone outside the hotel’s network gained access to the janitor’s ID badge and master key, they could access any room in the hotel. In this example, the janitor with the master key represents a user using sudo for elevated privileges. Because of the dangers of sudo, only users who really need to use it should have these permissions.

Additionally, even if you need access to sudo, you should be careful about using it with only the commands you need and nothing more. Running commands with sudo allows users to bypass the typical security controls that are in place to prevent elevated access to an attacker.

Note: Be aware of sudo if copying commands from an online source. It’s important you don’t use sudo accidentally. 

Authentication and authorization with sudo

You can use sudo with many authentication and authorization management tasks. As a reminder, authentication is the process of verifying who someone is, and authorization is the concept of granting access to specific resources in a system. Some of the key commands used for these tasks include the following:

useradd

The useradd command adds a user to the system. To add a user with the username of fgarcia with sudo, enter sudo useradd fgarcia. There are additional options you can use with useradd:

-g: Sets the user’s default group, also called their primary group

-G: Adds the user to additional groups, also called supplemental or secondary groups

To use the -g option, the primary group must be specified after -g. For example, entering sudo useradd -g security fgarcia adds fgarcia as a new user and assigns their primary group to be security.

To use the -G option, the supplemental group must be passed into the command after -G. You can add more than one supplemental group at a time with the -G option. Entering sudo useradd -G finance,admin fgarcia adds fgarcia as a new user and adds them to the existing finance and admin groups.

usermod

The usermod command modifies existing user accounts. The same -g and -G options from the useradd command can be used with usermod if a user already exists. 

To change the primary group of an existing user, you need the -g option. For example, entering sudo usermod -g executive fgarcia would change fgarcia’s primary group to the executive group.

To add a supplemental group for an existing user, you need the -G option. You also need a -a option, which appends the user to an existing group and is only used with the -G option. For example, entering sudo usermod -a -G marketing fgarcia would add the existing fgarcia user to the supplemental marketing group.

Note: When changing the supplemental group of an existing user, if you don't include the -a option, -G will replace any existing supplemental groups with the groups specified after usermod.  Using -a with -G ensures that the new groups are added but existing groups are not replaced.

There are other options you can use with usermod to specify how you want to modify the user, including:

-d: Changes the user’s home directory.

-l: Changes the user’s login name.

-L: Locks the account so the user can’t log in.

The option always goes after the usermod command. For example, to change fgarcia’s home directory to /home/garcia_f, enter sudo usermod -d /home/garcia_f fgarcia. The option -d directly follows the command usermod before the other two needed arguments.

userdel

The userdel command deletes a user from the system. For example, entering sudo userdel fgarcia deletes fgarcia as a user. Be careful before you delete a user using this command.

The userdel command doesn’t delete the files in the user’s home directory unless you use the -r option. Entering sudo userdel -r fgarcia would delete fgarcia as a user and delete all files in their home directory. Before deleting any user files, you should ensure you have backups in case you need them later.

Note: Instead of deleting the user, you could consider deactivating their account with usermod -L. This prevents the user from logging in while still giving you access to their account and associated permissions. For example, if a user left an organization, this option would allow you to identify which files they have ownership over, so you could move this ownership to other users.

chown

The chown command changes ownership of a file or directory. You can use chown to change user or group ownership. To change the user owner of the access.txt file to fgarcia, enter sudo chown fgarcia access.txt. To change the group owner of access.txt to security, enter sudo chown :security access.txt. You must enter a colon (:) before security to designate it as a group name.

Similar to useradd, usermod, and userdel, there are additional options that can be used with chown. 
Navigate Linux and read file content
In this reading, you’ll review how to navigate the file system using Linux commands in Bash. You’ll further explore the organization of the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, review several common Linux commands for navigation and reading file content, and learn a couple of new commands.

Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
Previously, you learned that the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) is the component of Linux that organizes data. The FHS is important because it defines how directories, directory contents, and other storage is organized in the operating system.

This diagram illustrates the hierarchy of relationships under the FHS:

Flowchart starts with the root directory at the top and branches down into multiple subdirectories.
Under the FHS, a file’s location can be described by a file path. A file path is the location of a file or directory. In the file path, the different levels of the hierarchy are separated by a forward slash (/).

Root directory
The root directory is the highest-level directory in Linux, and it’s always represented with a forward slash (/).  All subdirectories branch off the root directory. Subdirectories can continue branching out to as many levels as necessary.

Standard FHS directories
Directly below the root directory, you’ll find standard FHS directories. In the diagram, home, bin, and etc are standard FHS directories. Here are a few examples of what standard directories contain:

/home: Each user in the system gets their own home directory.

/bin: This directory stands for “binary” and contains binary files and other executables. Executables are files that contain a series of commands a computer needs to follow to run programs and perform other functions.

/etc: This directory stores the system’s configuration files.

/tmp: This directory stores many temporary files. The /tmp directory is commonly used by attackers because anyone in the system can modify data in these files.

/mnt: This directory stands for “mount” and stores media, such as USB drives and hard drives.

Pro Tip: You can use the man hier command to learn more about the FHS and its standard directories.

User-specific subdirectories
Under home are subdirectories for specific users. In the diagram, these users are  analyst and analyst2. Each user has their own personal subdirectories, such as projects, logs, or reports.

Note: When the path leads to a subdirectory below the user’s home directory, the user’s home directory can be represented as the tilde (~). For example, /home/analyst/logs can also be represented as ~/logs.

You can navigate to specific subdirectories using their absolute or relative file paths. The absolute file path is the full file path, which starts from the root. For example, /home/analyst/projects is an absolute file path. The relative file path is the file path that starts from a user's current directory.

Note: Relative file paths can use a dot (.) to represent the current directory, or two dots (..) to represent the parent of the current directory. An example of a relative file path could be ../projects.

Key commands for navigating the file system
The following Linux commands can be used to navigate the file system: pwd, ls, and cd.

pwd
The pwd command prints the working directory to the screen. Or in other words, it returns the directory that you’re currently in. 

The output gives you the absolute path to this directory. For example, if you’re in your home directory and your username is analyst, entering pwd returns /home/analyst. 

Pro Tip: To learn what your username is, use the whoami command. The whoami command returns the username of the current user. For example, if your username is analyst, entering whoami returns analyst.

ls
The ls command displays the names of the files and directories in the current working directory. For example, in the video, ls returned directories such as logs, and a file called updates.txt. 

Note: If you want to return the contents of a directory that’s not your current working directory, you can add an argument after ls with the absolute or relative file path to the desired directory. For example, if you’re in the /home/analyst directory but want to list the contents of its projects subdirectory, you can enter ls /home/analyst/projects or just ls projects.

cd
The cd command navigates between directories. When you need to change directories, you should use this command.

To navigate to a subdirectory of the current directory, you can add an argument after cd with the subdirectory name. For example, if you’re in the /home/analyst directory and want to navigate to its projects subdirectory, you can enter cd projects.

You can also navigate to any specific directory by entering the absolute file path. For example, if you’re in /home/analyst/projects, entering cd /home/analyst/logs changes your current directory to /home/analyst/logs.

Pro Tip: You can use the relative file path and enter cd .. to go up one level in the file structure. For example, if the current directory is /home/analyst/projects, entering cd .. would change your working directory to /home/analyst. 

Common commands for reading file content
The following Linux commands are useful for reading file content: cat, head, tail, and less.

cat
The cat command displays the content of a file. For example, entering cat updates.txt returns everything in the updates.txt file.

head
The head command displays just the beginning of a file, by default 10 lines. The head command can be useful when you want to know the basic contents of a file but don’t need the full contents. Entering head updates.txt returns only the first 10 lines of the updates.txt file.

Pro Tip: If you want to change the number of lines returned by head, you can specify the number of lines by including -n. For example, if you only want to display the first five lines of the updates.txt file, enter head -n 5 updates.txt.

tail
The tail command does the opposite of head. This command can be used to display just the end of a file, by default 10 lines. Entering tail updates.txt returns only the last 10 lines of the updates.txt file.

Pro Tip: You can use tail to read the most recent information in a log file.

less
The less command returns the content of a file one page at a time. For example, entering less updates.txt changes the terminal window to display the contents of updates.txt one page at a time. This allows you to easily move forward and backward through the content. 

Once you’ve accessed your content with the less command, you can use several keyboard controls to move through the file:

Space bar: Move forward one page

b: Move back one page

Down arrow: Move forward one line

Up arrow: Move back one line

q: Quit and return to the previous terminal window

SQL filtering versus Linux filtering
In this reading, you'll explore the differences between the two tools as they relate to filtering. You'll also learn that one way to access SQL is through the Linux command line.

Accessing SQL
There are many interfaces for accessing SQL and many different versions of SQL. One way to access SQL is through the Linux command line.

To access SQL from Linux, you need to type in a command for the version of SQL that you want to use. For example, if you want to access SQLite, you can enter the command sqlite3 in the command line.

After this, any commands typed in the command line will be directed to SQL instead of Linux commands.

Differences between Linux and SQL filtering 
Although both Linux and SQL allow you to filter through data, there are some differences that affect which one you should choose.

Purpose
Linux filters data in the context of files and directories on a computer system. It’s used for tasks like searching for specific files, manipulating file permissions, or managing processes. 

SQL is used to filter data within a database management system. It’s used for querying and manipulating data stored in tables and retrieving specific information based on defined criteria. 

Syntax
Linux uses various commands and command-line options specific to each filtering tool. Syntax varies depending on the tool and purpose. Some examples of Linux commands are find, sed, cut, e grep

SQL uses the Structured Query Language (SQL), a standardized language with specific keywords and clauses for filtering data across different SQL databases. Some examples of SQL keywords and clauses are WHERE, SELECT, JOIN

Structure
SQL offers a lot more structure than Linux, which is more free-form and not as tidy.

For example, if you wanted to access a log of employee log-in attempts, SQL would have each record separated into columns. Linux would print the data as a line of text without this organization. As a result, selecting a specific column to analyze would be easier and more efficient in SQL.

In terms of structure, SQL provides results that are more easily readable and that can be adjusted more quickly than when using Linux.

Joining tables
Some security-related decisions require information from different tables. SQL allows the analyst to join multiple tables together when returning data. Linux doesn’t have that same functionality; it doesn’t allow data to be connected to other information on your computer. This is more restrictive for an analyst going through security logs.

Best uses
As a security analyst, it’s important to understand when you can use which tool. Although SQL has a more organized structure and allows you to join tables, this doesn’t mean that there aren’t situations that would require you to filter data in Linux.

A lot of data used in cybersecurity will be stored in a database format that works with SQL. However, other logs might be in a format that is not compatible with SQL. For instance, if the data is stored in a text file, you cannot search through it with SQL. In those cases, it is useful to know how to filter in Linux. 
---------
Query a database
In this reading, you’ll review those basic SQL queries and learn a new keyword that will help you organize your output. You'll also learn about the Chinook database, which this course uses for queries in readings and quizzes.

Basic SQL query
There are two essential keywords in any SQL query: SELECT and FROM. You will use these keywords every time you want to query a SQL database. Using them together helps SQL identify what data you need from a database and the table you are returning it from.

The video demonstrated this SQL query:

SELECT employee_id, device_id

FROM employees;

In readings and quizzes, this course uses a sample database called the Chinook database to run queries. The Chinook database includes data that might be created at a digital media company. A security analyst employed by this company might need to query this data.  For example, the database contains eleven tables, including an employees table, a customers table, and an invoices table. These tables include data such as names and addresses.  

As an example, you can run this query to return data from the customers table of the Chinook database:


SELECT customerid, city, country
FROM customers;
The WHERE clause and basic operators
Previously, you focused on how to refine your SQL queries by using the WHERE clause to filter results. In this reading, you’ll further explore how to use the WHERE clause, the LIKE operator and the percentage sign (%) wildcard. You’ll also be introduced to the underscore (_), another wildcard that can help you filter queries.

How filtering helps
As a security analyst, you'll often be responsible for working with very large and complicated security logs. To find the information you need, you'll often need to use SQL to filter the logs.

In a cybersecurity context, you might use filters to find the login attempts of a specific user or all login attempts made at the time of a security issue. As another example, you might filter to find the devices that are running a specific version of an application.

WHERE 
To create a filter in SQL, you need to use the keyword WHERE. WHERE indicates the condition for a filter.

If you needed to email employees with a title of IT Staff, you might use a query like the one in the following example. You can run this example to examine what it returns: 

123
SELECT firstname, lastname, title, email
FROM employees
WHERE title = 'IT Staff';
Reset
+-----------+----------+----------+------------------------+
| FirstName | LastName | Title    | Email                  |
+-----------+----------+----------+------------------------+
| Robert    | King     | IT Staff | robert@chinookcorp.com |
| Laura     | Callahan | IT Staff | laura@chinookcorp.com  |
+-----------+----------+----------+------------------------+
Rather than returning all records in the employees table, this WHERE clause instructs SQL to return only those that contain 'IT Staff' in the title column. It uses the equals sign (=) operator to set this condition.

Note: You should place the semicolon (;) where the query ends. When you add a filter to a basic query, the semicolon is after the filter. 

Filtering for patterns
You can also filter based on a pattern. For example, you can identify entries that start or end with a certain character or characters. Filtering for a pattern requires incorporating two more elements into your WHERE clause:

a wildcard 

the LIKE operator

Wildcards
A wildcard is a special character that can be substituted with any other character. Two of the most useful wildcards are the percentage sign (%) and the underscore (_):

The percentage sign substitutes for any number of other characters. 

The underscore symbol only substitutes for one other character.

These wildcards can be placed after a string, before a string, or in both locations depending on the pattern you’re filtering for.

The following table includes these wildcards applied to the string 'a' and examples of what each pattern would return.

Pattern

Results that could be returned

'a%'

apple123, art, a

'a_'

as, an, a7

'a__' 

ant, add, a1c

'%a'

pizza, Z6ra, a

'_a'

ma, 1a, Ha

'%a%'

Again, back, a

'_a_'

Car, ban, ea7

LIKE
To apply wildcards to the filter, you need to use the LIKE operator instead of an equals sign (=). LIKE is used with WHERE to search for a pattern in a column. 

For instance, if you want to email employees with a title of either 'IT Staff' or 'IT Manager', you can use LIKE operator combined with the % wildcard:  

123
SELECT lastname, firstname, title, email
FROM employees
WHERE title LIKE 'IT%';
Reset
+----------+-----------+------------+-------------------------+
| LastName | FirstName | Title      | Email                   |
+----------+-----------+------------+-------------------------+
| Mitchell | Michael   | IT Manager | michael@chinookcorp.com |
| King     | Robert    | IT Staff   | robert@chinookcorp.com  |
| Callahan | Laura     | IT Staff   | laura@chinookcorp.com   |
+----------+-----------+------------+-------------------------+
This query returns all records with values in the title column that start with the pattern of 'IT'. This means both 'IT Staff' and 'IT Manager' are returned.

As another example, if you want to search through the invoices table to find all customers located in states with an abbreviation of 'NY', 'NV', 'NS' or 'NT', you can use the 'N_' pattern on the state column:

123
SELECT firstname,lastname, state, country
FROM customers
WHERE state LIKE 'N_';
Reset
+-----------+----------+-------+---------+
| FirstName | LastName | State | Country |
+-----------+----------+-------+---------+
| Michelle  | Brooks   | NY    | USA     |
| Kathy     | Chase    | NV    | USA     |
| Martha    | Silk     | NS    | Canada  |
| Ellie     | Sullivan | NT    | Canada  |
+-----------+----------+-------+---------+
This returns all the records with state abbreviations that follow this pattern.
+------------+---------------------+----------------+
| CustomerId | City                | Country        |
+------------+---------------------+----------------+

SELECT
The SELECT keyword indicates which columns to return. For example, you can return the customerid column from the Chinook database with

SELECT customerid

You can also select multiple columns by separating them with a comma. For example, if you want to return both the customerid and city columns, you should write SELECT customerid, city.

If you want to return all columns in a table, you can follow the SELECT keyword with an asterisk (*). The first line in the query will be SELECT *.

Note: Although the tables you're querying in this course are relatively small, using SELECT * may not be advisable when working with large databases and tables; in those cases, the final output may be difficult to understand and might be slow to run. 

FROM
The SELECT keyword always comes with the FROM keyword. FROM indicates which table to query. To use the FROM keyword, you should write it after the SELECT keyword, often on a new line, and follow it with the name of the table you’re querying. If you want to return all columns from the customers table, you can write:

SELECT *

FROM customers;

When you want to end the query here, you put a semicolon (;) at the end to tell SQL that this is the entire query.

Note: Line breaks are not necessary in SQL queries, but are often used to make the query easier to understand. If you prefer, you can also write the previous query on one line as

SELECT * FROM customers;

ORDER BY
Database tables are often very complicated, and this is where other SQL keywords come in handy. ORDER BY is an important keyword for organizing the data you extract from a table.

ORDER BY sequences the records returned by a query based on a specified column or columns. This can be in either ascending or descending order.

Sorting in ascending order
To use the ORDER BY keyword, write it at the end of the query and specify a column to base the sort on. In this example, SQL will return the customerid, city, and country columns from the customers table, and the records will be sequenced by the city column:

123
SELECT customerid, city, country
FROM customers
ORDER BY city;

The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records based on the column specified after this keyword. By default, as shown in this example, the sequence will be in ascending order. This means

if you choose a column containing numeric data, it sorts the output from the smallest to largest. For example, if sorting on customerid, the ID numbers are sorted from smallest to largest.

if the column contains alphabetic characters, such as in the example with the city column, it orders the records from the beginning of the alphabet to the end. 

Sorting in descending order
You can also use the ORDER BY with the DESC keyword to sort in descending order. The DESC keyword is short for "descending" and tells SQL to sort numbers from largest to smallest, or alphabetically from Z to A. This can be done by following ORDER BY with the DESC keyword. For example, you can run this query to examine how the results differ when DESC is applied: 

123
SELECT customerid, city, country
FROM customers
ORDER BY city DESC;

Now, cities at the end of the alphabet are listed first.

Sorting based on multiple columns
You can also choose multiple columns to order by. For example, you might first choose the country and then the city column. SQL then sorts the output by country, and for rows with the same country, it sorts them based on city. You can run this to explore how SQL displays this:

123
SELECT customerid, city, country
FROM customers
ORDER BY country, city;

Key takeaways
SELECT and FROM are important keywords in SQL queries. You use SELECT to indicate which columns to return and FROM to indicate which table to query. You can also include ORDER BY in your query to organize the output. These foundational SQL skills will support you as you move into more advanced queries.

Operators for filtering dates and numbers
Previously, you examined operators like less than (<) or greater than (>) and explored how they can be used in filtering numeric and date and time data types. This reading summarizes what you learned and provides new examples of using operators in filters.

Numbers, dates, and times in cybersecurity
Security analysts work with more than just string data, or data consisting of an ordered sequence of characters. 

They also frequently work with numeric data, or data consisting of numbers. A few examples of numeric data that you might encounter in your work as a security analyst include:

the number of login attempts

the count of a specific type of log entry

the volume of data being sent from a source

the volume of data being sent to a destination

You'll also encounter date and time data, or data representing a date and/or time. As a first example, logs will generally timestamp every record. Other time and date data might include:

login dates

login times

dates for patches 

the duration of a connection

Comparison operators
In SQL, filtering numeric and date and time data often involves operators. You can use the following operators in your filters to make sure you return only the rows you need:

operator

use

<

less than

>

greater than

=

equal to

<=

less than or equal to

>=

greater than or equal to

<>

not equal to

Note: You can also use != as an alternative operator for not equal to.
























Portfolio projects
As previously mentioned, you will have multiple opportunities throughout the certificate program to develop items to include in your portfolio. These opportunities include:

Drafting a professional statement

Conducting a security audit

üõ°Ô∏è Managing Common Threats, Risks & Vulnerabilities
As cybersecurity professionals, one of our main responsibilities is protecting both digital and physical assets from threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. Understanding the modern threat landscape is critical for creating strong security policies and response strategies.

üéØ Risk Management
An asset is anything of value to an organization, such as:

üîê Digital assets: SSNs, DOBs, bank details, personal info

üñ•Ô∏è Physical assets: Servers, kiosks, desktop computers

Common Risk Management Strategies:
Strategy	Description
Acceptance	Accept the risk to maintain business continuity
Avoidance	Avoid activities that introduce the risk
Transference	Transfer risk to a third party (e.g., insurance, vendor)
Mitigation	Reduce the impact/likelihood of the risk

üß∞ Frameworks often used:

NIST RMF (Risk Management Framework)

HITRUST (Health Information Trust Alliance)

üö® Threats
A threat is any event or actor that can negatively impact assets.

Threat Type	Description
Insider Threats	Authorized personnel misusing access
Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)	Long-term, stealthy system compromise by external actors

‚ö†Ô∏è Risks
A risk is the potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability.

Risk = Likelihood of Threat x Impact

Risk Type	Examples
External Risk	Hackers, phishing, malware
Internal Risk	Disgruntled employees, vendor misuse
Legacy Systems	Unpatched, outdated systems still connected
Multiparty Risk	Vendors or third-parties having access to sensitive IP
Compliance Risks	Outdated software or missing security patches

üõë Stay updated using:

NIST risk catalogs

OWASP Top 10

üï≥Ô∏è Vulnerabilities
A vulnerability is a weakness that could be exploited by a threat actor.

Vulnerability	Description
ProxyLogon	Remote code execution on Microsoft Exchange servers
ZeroLogon	Exploits Microsoft Netlogon protocol
Log4Shell	Remote code execution via Java‚Äôs Log4j utility
PetitPotam	Exploits NTLM for Windows LAN authentication theft
Security Logging Failure	Poor logging/monitoring lets threats go undetected
SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)	Tricks server into exposing internal resources

üë®‚Äçüíª Entry-level security analysts often begin in Vulnerability Management ‚Äì continuously scanning systems, applying patches, and reducing exposure.

üõ†Ô∏è Quick Summary
Category       	Definition	                            Example

### ‚úÖ What is a Datagram?

* A **datagram** is a **self-contained packet** that carries all necessary information to be routed from source to destination **independently**.
* Both **IPv4** and **IPv6** packets are datagrams.

---

### üåê IPv4 vs IPv6

* **IPv4** = 32-bit address, \~4.3 billion addresses
* **IPv6** = 128-bit address, massive number of addresses
* IPv6 headers are **simpler** than IPv4 (e.g., **no Header Checksum** in IPv6)

### üß± IPv4 Packet Structure

**Header (min 20 bytes)** + **Payload**

| Field                        | Purpose                                                            |

| Options & Padding            | Rarely used, adds up to multiple of 32-bit words                   |

---

### üñß MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)

* Max IP packet size **depends on Layer 2**:

  * **Ethernet**: 1500 bytes
  * **Wi-Fi**: 2304 bytes
* If IP packet > MTU: fragmentation may occur unless **Don't Fragment flag = 1**

---

### üßÆ CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

* Format: `IP/mask`, e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`
* `/24` means **first 24 bits are network** ‚Üí **255.255.255.0**
* Replaced classful (A, B, C) system
* Uses **VLSM** (Variable Length Subnet Masking) to assign subnet sizes more efficiently
* Enables **IPv4 & IPv6** block allocation to ISPs or users

---

### üßæ Header Checksum (IPv4 only)

* 16-bit field
* Used for error detection in **header only**, **not payload**
* Recomputed at each router due to changes like TTL decrement

---

### üöÄ TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

* **Connection-oriented**, reliable
* Header size: **min 20 bytes**

| Field                   | Purpose                                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Source Port / Dest Port | App layer communication                        |
| Sequence Number         | Order of bytes                                 |

| Data Offset             | Header length in 32-bit words                  |
| Flags                   | URG, ACK, PSH, RST, SYN, FIN                   |
| Window                  | Flow control                                   |
| Checksum                | Covers header + data + pseudo header           |
| Urgent Pointer          | Used if URG flag = 1 (urgent data starts here) |

* **PSH Flag**: Pushes data to app immediately
* **URG Flag + Urgent Pointer**: Mark part of data as urgent

---

### üì¶ UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

* **Connectionless**, fast, unreliable
* Header: 8 bytes only

| Field                   | Purpose                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Source Port / Dest Port | Communication                        |
| Length                  | UDP header + data length             |
| Checksum                | Optional in IPv4 (mandatory in IPv6) |

* **No flags**, **no urgent pointer**, **no sequence or ack numbers**
* **TTL is handled by IP**, not UDP/TCP

---

### ‚ùå Common Wrong Statements (For MCQs)

* IPv6 **is** a datagram ‚Üí ‚úÖ TRUE
* IPv4 can always send 65,535 octets ‚Üí ‚ùå FALSE (limited by MTU)
* UDP/TCP has TTL ‚Üí ‚ùå FALSE (TTL is part of IP header)

* UDP uses PSH, URG flags ‚Üí ‚ùå FALSE (That‚Äôs TCP-only)
* CIDR is only for IPv4 ‚Üí ‚ùå FALSE (Used for both IPv4 & IPv6)

---

### ‚úÖ IPv6 Jumbograms

* For data > 65,535 bytes
* Payload Length = 0 (all bits zero)
* Jumbo Payload Option header used

| 1101                                   | 0xd | 13      |
| 1110                                   | 0xe | 14      |
| 1111                                   | 0xf | 15      |
| **Wrong example**: `0000 = 0xg = 16` ‚ùå |     |         |

---

### ‚ú® Summary

* **IPv4 & IPv6** use datagrams
* **TCP** = reliable, connection-based; **UDP** = fast, connectionless
* **CIDR** is flexible and used in both IPv4/IPv6
* MTU limits packet size despite total length allowing 65,535
* Checksum protects headers; **TCP's checksum covers more**

---

> ‚úÖ Tip: Use Wireshark to inspect real packet headers. It‚Äôll make these fields make sense like magic!

## üåê Internet Routing & Protocols (IGP vs EGP)

### üî∏ Autonomous Systems (AS)

* **Autonomous System**: A network (like an ISP, university, or enterprise) controlled by a single admin.

### üî∏ IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol)

* Used **within** an AS.
* Examples:

  * **RIP** (Routing Information Protocol) ‚Äì Distance-vector
  * **OSPF** (Open Shortest Path First) ‚Äì Link-state
  * **IS-IS** ‚Äì Link-state
  * **EIGRP** ‚Äì Cisco proprietary, hybrid

### üî∏ EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol)

* Used **between** ASes.
* Example:

  * **BGPv4** (Border Gateway Protocol v4)

    * Used **on the Internet**.
    * Supports **external BGP (eBGP)** & **internal BGP (iBGP)**.

### üîí BGP Security Challenges

* Different ISPs ‚Üí different encryption/security protocols ‚Üí harder coordination
* BGP messages vulnerable to **spoofing** & **malware** if not properly secured

---

## üì° OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)

### üìå Overview

* Most widely used IGP
* Supports **IPv4, IPv6, CIDR**
* Uses **Link-State Routing** and **Dijkstra's Algorithm**

### üß† How It Works

1. Routers collect **Link-State Advertisements (LSAs)**
2. Build **Link-State Database (LSDB)**
3. Compute **Shortest Path Tree (SPT)** from the source
4. Populate routing table based on SPT

### üîÅ Updates

* If network changes, all steps repeat to maintain accuracy.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Link Cost Factors

* **Hop count**, **RTT**, **throughput**, **availability**, **reliability**

### üìê Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm Steps

1. Start with only source node in set `M`
2. Add nearest neighbor with minimum cumulative link cost
3. Repeat until all nodes are in set `M`
4. Result = shortest path tree with **no loops**

### üìä Routing Table Example

* Source ‚Üí Destination with least cost path

### üß© OSPF Router Types

* **IR** (Internal Router): All interfaces in same area
* **ABR** (Area Border Router): Connects sub-areas to backbone
* **BR** (Backbone Router): Within backbone area
* **ASBR** (Autonomous System Boundary Router): Connects ASes

### üì£ Multicast OSPF (MOSPF)

* Extension of OSPF for multicast routing
* Uses **group membership** info
* Alternate: OSPF with **PIM** (Protocol Independent Multicast)

### üåê OSPF Subdivision

* Divides large network into subareas + backbone
* Benefits: better administration, performance, security

### üö¶ Traffic Engineering

* Goal: Optimize routing reliability and performance
* Works for IP & Optical networks

## üß≠ Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) & NDP

### üìå ARP

* Maps **IPv4 address ‚Üí MAC address** (Data Link Layer)
* Used in **Ethernet** and **Wi-Fi**
* Defined in **RFC 826**
* Managed by **IANA**

### üßæ ARP Packet Format

| Hardware Addr Length | 6 (MAC)                   |
| Protocol Addr Length | 4 (IPv4)                  |
| Operation            | 1=Request, 2=Reply        |
| Sender MAC           | Sender‚Äôs MAC              |
| Sender IP            | Sender‚Äôs IP               |
| Target MAC           | Receiver‚Äôs MAC (if known) |
| Target IP            | Receiver‚Äôs IP             |

### üìå NDP (Neighbor Discovery Protocol)

* Used in **IPv6** (replaces ARP)
* Also maps IPv6 ‚Üí MAC
* Used for Wi-Fi and other IPv6-enabled networks

Overview of network protocols
A network protocol is a set of rules used by two or more devices on a network to describe the order of delivery and the structure of data. Network protocols serve as instructions that come with the information in the data packet. These instructions tell the receiving device what to do with the data. Protocols are like a common language that allows devices all across the world to communicate with and understand each other.

Even though network protocols perform an essential function in network communication, security analysts should still understand their associated security implications. Some protocols have vulnerabilities that malicious actors exploit. For example, a nefarious actor could use the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol, which resolves web addresses to IP addresses, to divert traffic from a legitimate website to a malicious website containing malware. You‚Äôll learn more about this topic in upcoming course materials. 

Three categories of network protocols
Network protocols can be divided into three main categories: communication protocols, management protocols, and security protocols. There are dozens of different network protocols, but you don‚Äôt need to memorize all of them for an entry-level security analyst role. However, it‚Äôs important for you to know the ones listed in this reading. 

Communication protocols
Communication protocols govern the exchange of information in network transmission. They dictate how the data is transmitted between devices and the timing of the communication. They also include methods to recover data lost in transit. Here are a few of them.

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is an internet communication protocol that allows two devices to form a connection and stream data. TCP uses a three-way handshake process. First, the device sends a synchronize (SYN) request to a server. Then the server responds with a SYN/ACK packet to acknowledge receipt of the device's request. Once the server receives the final ACK packet from the device, a TCP connection is established. In the TCP/IP model, TCP occurs at the transport layer.

User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol that does not establish a connection between devices before a transmission. This makes it less reliable than TCP. But it also means that it works well for transmissions that need to get to their destination quickly. For example, one use of UDP is for sending DNS requests to local DNS servers. In the TCP/IP model, UDP occurs at the transport layer.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol that provides a method of communication between clients and website servers. HTTP uses port 80. HTTP is considered insecure, so it is being replaced on most websites by a secure version, called HTTPS that uses encryption from SSL/TLS for communication. However, there are still many websites that use the insecure HTTP protocol. In the TCP/IP model, HTTP occurs at the application layer.

Domain Name System (DNS) is a protocol that translates internet domain names into IP addresses. When a client computer wishes to access a website domain using their internet browser, a query is sent to a dedicated DNS server. The DNS server then looks up the IP address that corresponds to the website domain. DNS normally uses UDP on port 53. However, if the DNS reply to a request is large, it will switch to using the TCP protocol. In the TCP/IP model, DNS occurs at the application layer.

Management Protocols
The next category of network protocols is management protocols. Management protocols are used for monitoring and managing activity on a network. They include protocols for error reporting and optimizing performance on the network.

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a network protocol used for monitoring and managing devices on a network. SNMP can reset a password on a network device or change its baseline configuration. It can also send requests to network devices for a report on how much of the network‚Äôs bandwidth is being used up. In the TCP/IP model, SNMP occurs at the application layer.

Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is an internet protocol used by devices to tell each other about data transmission errors across the network. ICMP is used by a receiving device to send a report to the sending device about the data transmission. ICMP is commonly used as a quick way to troubleshoot network connectivity and latency by issuing the ‚Äúping‚Äù command on a Linux operating system. In the TCP/IP model, ICMP occurs at the internet layer.

Security Protocols
Security protocols are network protocols that ensure that data is sent and received securely across a network. Security protocols use encryption algorithms to protect data in transit. Below are some common security protocols.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is a network protocol that provides a secure method of communication between clients and website servers. HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that uses secure sockets layer/transport layer security (SSL/TLS) encryption on all transmissions so that malicious actors cannot read the information contained. HTTPS uses port 443. In the TCP/IP model, HTTPS occurs at the application layer.

Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is a secure protocol used to transfer files from one device to another over a network. SFTP uses secure shell (SSH), typically through TCP port 22. SSH uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and other types of encryption to ensure that unintended recipients cannot intercept the transmissions. In the TCP/IP model, SFTP occurs at the application layer. SFTP is used often with cloud storage. Every time a user uploads or downloads a file from cloud storage, the file is transferred using the SFTP protocol.

Note: The encryption protocols mentioned do not conceal the source or destination IP address of network traffic. This means a malicious actor can still learn some basic information about the network traffic if they intercept it. 

Additional network protocols
In previous readings and videos, you learned how network protocols organize the sending and receiving of data across a network. You also learned that protocols can be divided into three categories: communication protocols, management protocols, and security protocols.

This reading will introduce you to a few additional concepts and protocols that will come up regularly in your work as a security analyst. Some protocols are assigned port numbers by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). These port numbers are included in the description of each protocol, if assigned. 

Network Address Translation
The devices on your local home or office network each have a private IP address that they use to communicate directly with each other. However, in order for the devices with private IP addresses to communicate with the public internet, they need to have a single public IP address that represents all devices on the LAN to the public. For outgoing messages, the router can replace a private source IP address with its public IP address and perform the reverse operation for responses. This process is known as Network Address Translation (NAT) and it generally requires a router or firewall to be specifically configured to perform NAT. NAT is a part of layer 2 (internet layer) and layer 3 (transport layer) of the TCP/IP model.

## Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol:
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is in the management family of network protocols. DHCP is an application layer protocol used on a network to configure devices. It works with the router to assign a unique IP address to each device and provide the addresses of the appropriate DNS server and default gateway for each device. DHCP servers operate on UDP port 67 while DHCP clients operate on UDP port 68.

Address Resolution Protocol
By now, you are familiar with IP and MAC addresses. You‚Äôve learned that each device on a network has a public IP address, a private IP address, and a MAC address that identify it on the network. A device‚Äôs IP address may change over time, but its MAC address is permanent because it is unique to a device's network interface card. The MAC address is used to communicate with devices within the same network, but sometimes, the MAC address is unknown. This is why the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is needed. ARP is mainly a network access layer protocol in the TCP/IP model used to translate the IP addresses that are found in data packets into the MAC address of the hardware device. 

Each device on the network performs ARP and keeps track of matching IP and MAC addresses in an ARP cache. ARP does not have a specific port number since it is a layer 2 protocol and port numbers are associated with the layer 7 application layer.

Telnet 
Telnet is an application layer protocol that is used to connect with a remote system. Telnet sends all information in clear text. It uses command line prompts to control another device similar to secure shell (SSH), but Telnet is not as secure as SSH. Telnet can be used to connect to local or remote devices and uses TCP port 23. 

Secure shell
Secure shell protocol (SSH) is used to create a secure connection with a remote system. This application layer protocol provides an alternative for secure authentication and encrypted communication. SSH operates over the TCP port 22 and is a replacement for less secure protocols, such as Telnet.

Post office protocol
Post office protocol (POP) is an application layer (layer 4 of the TCP/IP model) protocol used to manage and retrieve email from a mail server. POP3 is the most commonly used version of POP. Many organizations have a dedicated mail server on the network that handles incoming and outgoing mail for users on the network. User devices will send requests to the remote mail server and download email messages locally. If you have ever refreshed your email application and had new emails populate in your inbox, you are experiencing POP and internet message access protocol (IMAP) in action. Unencrypted, plaintext authentication uses TCP/UDP port 110 and encrypted emails use Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) over TCP/UDP port 995.  When using POP, mail has to finish downloading on a local device before it can be read. After downloading, the mail may or may not be deleted from the mail server, so it does not guarantee that a user can sync the same email across multiple devices. 

Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
IMAP is used for incoming email. It downloads the headers of emails and the message content. The content also remains on the email server, which allows users to access their email from multiple devices. IMAP uses TCP port 143 for unencrypted email and TCP port 993 over the TLS protocol. Using IMAP allows users to partially read email before it is finished downloading. Since the mail is kept on the mail server, it allows a user to sync emails across multiple devices. 

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used to transmit and route email from the sender to the recipient‚Äôs address. SMTP works with Message Transfer Agent (MTA) software, which searches DNS servers to resolve email addresses to IP addresses, to ensure emails reach their intended destination. SMTP uses TCP/UDP port 25 for unencrypted emails and TCP/UDP port 587 using TLS for encrypted emails. The TCP port 25 is often used by high-volume spam. SMTP helps to filter out spam by regulating how many emails a source can send at a time.

Protocols and port numbers
Remember that port numbers are used by network devices to determine what should be done with the information contained in each data packet once they reach their destination. Firewalls can filter out unwanted traffic based on port numbers. For example, an organization may configure a firewall to only allow access to TCP port 995 (POP3) by IP addresses belonging to the organization.

As a security analyst, you will need to know about many of the protocols and port numbers mentioned in this course. They may be used to determine your technical knowledge in interviews, so it‚Äôs a good idea to memorize them. You will also learn about new protocols on the job in a security position.

## üß† **Subnetting and CIDR ‚Äì Easy Summary for Cybersecurity**

---

### üîπ What is Subnetting?

**Subnetting** = Dividing a large network into **smaller logical networks** (called **subnets**).

* Think of it as **"a network inside a network."**
* Helps isolate zones: üì¶ internal, üîí restricted, üåê public (like DMZ).
* Increases **efficiency**, **speed**, and **security**.
* Used to create **security zones** like:

  * ‚úÖ Controlled zone
  * üö´ Restricted zone
  * üåç Uncontrolled zone
  * ‚öîÔ∏è DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)

---

### üß± Why Use Subnetting?

* Limits traffic within subnets (local traffic doesn‚Äôt go to the router).
* Segments **sensitive systems** from **public-facing** ones.
* Reduces **attack surface** ‚Äì limits lateral movement in attacks.
* Allows **more control** over bandwidth and policies per subnet.

---

### üîπ CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

**CIDR Notation** = `IP address / Prefix`

Example: `192.168.1.0/24`

* `/24` = Network mask with **24 bits for network**, remaining **8 bits for hosts**.
* IP Range = `192.168.1.0 ‚Üí 192.168.1.255` (total: **256 IPs**)

#### üÜö CIDR vs Classful:

| Feature           | Classful             | CIDR                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Uses fixed ranges | Yes (Class A/B/C...) | No                      |
| Efficient?        | ‚ùå Wasteful           | ‚úÖ More efficient        |
| Routing tables?   | Large                | Compact (fewer entries) |
| Flexibility       | Low                  | High                    |

---

### üìê CIDR Benefits in Security

* Allows you to create **custom-sized networks** (no IP waste).
* Helps create **network segmentation** strategies (e.g., isolating IoT or HR devices).
* You don‚Äôt need to request new IPs from ISP ‚Äî saves cost and setup time.
* Can work with:

  * üîÑ **Routing configurations**
  * üî• **Firewalls**
  * üõ°Ô∏è **Security zones**

---

### ‚úÖ Example Use Case:

* A company wants to separate **HR**, **IT**, and **Guest Wi-Fi**.
* Subnetting helps create:

  * `192.168.10.0/24` ‚Üí HR
  * `192.168.20.0/24` ‚Üí IT
  * `192.168.30.0/24` ‚Üí Guests
    Each is isolated from the others = **better security + performance**.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Security Considerations

Earlier in this course, I was introduced to **cloud computing**, a model that enables convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. These resources can be provisioned and released with minimal management effort or interaction with the service provider.

Just like traditional IT infrastructure, **cloud infrastructure must be secured**. This entry explores the unique security challenges presented by cloud computing and introduces the **shared responsibility model**.

---

### üîê Key Cloud Security Considerations

#### 1. Identity Access Management (IAM)
- IAM involves the processes and technologies used to manage **digital identities**.
- Improper configuration of user roles can give unauthorized users access to critical cloud operations.
- Proper role-based access controls are essential to minimize this risk.

#### 2. Configuration Management
- Cloud services require precise and secure configuration.
- During **cloud migrations**, improperly configured services can introduce major vulnerabilities.
- Misconfigurations are among the **leading causes of cloud security breaches**.

#### 3. Attack Surface Expansion
- Each service or application added to the cloud increases the **organization‚Äôs attack surface**.
- More services = more entry points, unless the network is designed securely.
- CSPs generally offer more secure, vetted infrastructure than traditional on-prem solutions.

#### 4. Zero-Day Attacks
- A **zero-day attack** exploits previously unknown vulnerabilities.
- CSPs typically discover and respond to zero-days faster than traditional IT teams.
- CSPs patch hypervisors and migrate workloads to prevent customer impact.

#### 5. Visibility & Tracking
- Like on-prem networks, cloud offers visibility via **flow logs** and **packet mirroring** tools.
- However, organizations may not be able to inspect the underlying CSP infrastructure.
- CSPs conduct **third-party audits** to verify the security posture and compliance.

#### 6. Rapid Changes in the Cloud
- Cloud services are updated frequently by CSPs, which can impact:
  - Network connectivity
  - Security settings
  - Configuration requirements
- Organizations must **adapt their IT processes** to align with CSP updates.

---

### ü§ù Shared Responsibility Model

- **Cloud Service Provider (CSP)** is responsible for:
  - Physical data centers
  - Host operating systems
  - Hypervisors and infrastructure-level security

- **Cloud Customers** are responsible for:
  - Data security
  - Application configurations
  - User access controls

Misunderstanding the division of responsibility can lead to security lapses, especially in **application-level misconfigurations**.

---

### ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- Cloud computing introduces **unique security challenges** that require proactive measures.
- **Identity access management**, **configuration security**, and **visibility** are core pillars.
- The **shared responsibility model** clarifies which security roles belong to the CSP and which are owned by the organization.
- Cloud adoption should be paired with **continuous monitoring**, **secure configurations**, and **trained security personnel**.

## üîí Cloud Security Hardening & Cryptography

Cloud infrastructure is becoming increasingly common, and like on-premise networks, cloud environments must also be secured. This entry explores **cloud security hardening practices**, **cryptography**, and the **shared responsibility model**‚Äîall key to protecting data and services in the cloud.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Common Cloud Security Hardening Techniques

Cloud security hardening involves using tools and best practices to **protect cloud network infrastructure** from threats. Below are the main techniques:

---

#### 1. Identity Access Management (IAM)
- IAM helps manage **digital user identities** and defines **who can do what** in the cloud.
- It ensures **authorized access** to cloud services while preventing unauthorized use.
- Weak or misconfigured IAM settings are a **common vulnerability**.

---

#### 2. Hypervisors
- A **hypervisor** separates the hardware from the virtual machines (VMs) running on it.
- Two types:
  - **Type 1 (bare-metal)**: Runs directly on hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi) ‚Äì used by CSPs.
  - **Type 2**: Runs on a host OS (e.g., VirtualBox).
- CSPs manage hypervisors and patch them regularly.
- **VM Escape**: A major threat where a hacker breaks out of a VM to access other systems.

---

#### 3. Baselining
- **Baselining** sets a **standard reference configuration** for the cloud environment.
- Helps detect and respond to unauthorized changes.
- Examples:
  - Restricting access to admin portals
  - Enabling password policies and encryption
  - Enabling threat detection (e.g., for SQL databases)

---

### üîê Cryptography in the Cloud

Cryptography protects **data confidentiality and integrity** in cloud environments. It uses encryption and secure key management systems.

#### 4. Encryption
- **Encryption** scrambles data into unreadable format (ciphertext) using a key.
- Only those with the **decryption key** can read the original data.
- Modern encryption depends on **key secrecy**, not algorithm secrecy.

---

#### 5. Cryptographic Erasure (Crypto-Shredding)
- Involves **destroying encryption keys** instead of data itself.
- Without the key, **data becomes unreadable**.
- Used when cloud data needs to be **securely deleted**.

---

### üîë Key Management in the Cloud

Proper key management is crucial to prevent unauthorized data access. Two common tools:

- **Trusted Platform Module (TPM)**: A chip that securely stores keys and credentials.
- **Cloud Hardware Security Module (CloudHSM)**: Manages cryptographic keys and operations like encryption/decryption in the cloud.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: 
> Customers can bring their own encryption keys (BYOK). If lost or exposed, **CSPs cannot help recover the data**. You're responsible for your key's security.

---

### üß† Shared Responsibility in Cryptography

Under the **shared responsibility model**:
- The **CSP** secures infrastructure (e.g., hypervisors, hardware, host OS).
- The **customer** secures:
  - Application-level configurations
  - IAM settings
  - Encryption keys (if BYOK is used)

Customers can also review **CSP audit reports and security certifications**. For government work, FEDRAMP provides a list of verified CSPs.

---

### ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- **Cloud security hardening** involves IAM, hypervisors, baselining, encryption, and crypto-erasure.
- **Cryptography** is essential to secure data at rest and in transit.
- Proper **key management** and understanding your role in the **shared responsibility model** are critical to cloud data protection.

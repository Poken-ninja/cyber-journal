## 📅 Week 1 (June 27 – July 3)
MUST HAVE TECHNICAL SKILLS : SIEM

### ✅ Day 1 – Friday, June 27
- 🎥 Watched Google Cybersecurity Course – Course 1 videos:
   - What is Cybersecurity
   - Types of Threats
   - Careers in Cyber
- 📝 Wrote in journal:
   - Why I want to learn cybersecurity
   I wanna learn cyber security becuase it amuses me. I don't know why but i find hacking intresting af.
   - 3 things I learned today:
     - Cybersecurity = protection of digital assets
     - Threats = malware, phishing, DoS, etc.
     - Cyber careers are diverse: analyst, engineer, hacker

## 🔐 Key Cybersecurity Concepts – Week 1

### 🧠 What Does a Cybersecurity Analyst Do?
- Monitors networks for security breaches and threats  
- Develops defense strategies for data and systems  
- Researches IT security trends and tools  
- Works to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber incidents

### 📚 Must-Know Concepts

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Compliance | Following internal policies and external regulations to avoid fines or breaches |
| Security Frameworks | Guidelines like NIST/ISO that help organizations structure security practices |
| Security Controls | Safeguards (firewalls, access controls, policies) to reduce risk |
| Security Posture | An org’s ability to defend and respond to threats |
| Threat Actor | Person or group posing a risk (hacker, criminal, nation-state) |
| Internal Threat | Risk from insiders: careless employee, rogue admin, partner |
| Network Security | Securing systems, devices, and data on internal networks |
| Cloud Security | Protecting cloud-hosted data and apps through proper configuration and access control |
| Programming | Writing scripts to automate tasks like scanning traffic, flagging threats, and log review |

### 💡 Examples
- MFA is a security control  
- Clicking a phishing link = accidental internal threat  
- Making S3 buckets private = cloud security best practice

## 🧰 Transferable & Technical Skills in Cybersecurity – Week 1

### 🔄 Transferable Skills (From life or other fields)

- Communication  
  - Collaborate with both tech and non-tech teams  
  - Clearly explain issues, findings, and risks

- Problem-solving  
  - Spot attack patterns and fix them  
  - Accept compromises; there’s rarely a perfect solution

- Time management  
  - Prioritize urgent tasks quickly  
  - Respond fast to minimize damage

- Growth mindset  
  - Be willing to keep learning  
  - The field evolves fast – stay updated

- Diverse perspectives  
  - Respect for team diversity = stronger solutions  
  - Collaboration helps build better defense strategies

---

### 🛠️ Technical Skills (Cyber-specific tools and concepts)

- Programming languages  
  - Automate tasks like log searches or data analysis  
  - Useful for writing scripts to detect patterns

- SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)  
  - Tools that collect and analyze event logs  
  - Help detect unusual login attempts or behaviors

- IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems)  
  - Alert on suspicious activities (e.g., unauthorized access)  
  - Used for real-time monitoring of systems

- Threat landscape awareness  
  - Stay updated on malware, exploits, ransomware trends  
  - Recognize emerging threat types

- Incident response  
  - Follow standard protocols during breaches  
  - Investigate, contain, and remediate security issues

---

### 🎓 Bonus: CompTIA Security+ Path
- Completing Google Cybersecurity Certificate unlocks:
  - 30% discount on CompTIA Security+ exam  
  - Extra practice materials  
  - A dual credential to boost your resume

---

### 📝 Key Takeaway
Both **transferable** and **technical** skills matter.  
Soft skills like communication + mindset + teamwork make you effective,  
while tools like SIEM, IDS, scripting, and threat knowledge make you dangerous.

## 🧨 Common Cyber Attacks and Why They Work – Week 1

### 🎣 Phishing Attacks

Phishing = using digital messages to trick people into revealing sensitive info or installing malware.

Types of phishing:

- Business Email Compromise (BEC): Fake email from known source requesting money or data
- Spear phishing: Targeted email scam toward a specific person or group
- Whaling: Spear phishing aimed at high-level executives
- Vishing: Voice phishing over phone calls or voicemails
- Smishing: Phishing done over SMS (text messages)

---

### 🐛 Malware Attacks

Malware = software created to damage, disrupt, or steal.

Types of malware:

- Virus: Needs user to run it; spreads through files, causes data damage
- Worm: Self-replicates and spreads across systems without user action
- Ransomware: Encrypts data and demands payment to unlock it
- Spyware: Secretly collects data like messages, location, or audio

---

### 🧠 Social Engineering

Social engineering = manipulating people into giving up info or access.

Types of social engineering:

- Social media phishing: Info from social media is used to craft targeted attacks
- Watering hole attack: Hackers infect websites visited by a specific group
- USB baiting: Malware-infected USB dropped for someone to plug in
- Physical access: Impersonation to sneak into secure buildings

---

### 🕵️ Social Engineering Principles

Why it works:

- Authority: Pretend to be boss, tech support, law enforcement
- Intimidation: Scare or pressure victims into acting
- Consensus/Social Proof: “Others already gave me access”
- Scarcity: “Only 2 left” or “time is running out” tactics
- Familiarity: Pretend to know the victim or act casual
- Trust: Build a fake relationship to extract info
- Urgency: Push people to act fast, skip verification

---

### 📝 Key Takeaways

- Attacks use **tech and psychology**
- Social engineering is rising because humans are the weakest link
- Awareness is the first layer of defense
- You'll see these attacks often in real-world scenarios — stay alert
